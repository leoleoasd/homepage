Online recruitment platforms typically employ Person-Job Fit models in the core service that automatically matching between suitable job seekers and the appropriate job positions. Existing works mainly focus on leveraging historical job application information or contextual information in job seekers' profiles and job descriptions. However, such methodologies are inadequate as they disregard a crucial information source: job seekers' social relationships in the professional network. In this paper, we underscore the importance of incorporating workplace social relationships into the Person-Job Fit model. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) defining a Heterogeneous Information Network (WHIN) to capture heterogeneous knowledge, including social relations and pre-training representations of various entities using a heterogeneous graph neural network; (2) designing a Contextual Social Attention Graph Neural Network (CSAGNN) that supplements users' missing information with workplace friends' contextual information. To handle noisy workplace social networks, we introduce a job-specific attention mechanism in CSAGNN, leveraging pre-trained entity representations from WHIN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental evaluations conducted across three real-world recruitment datasets, showing superior performance compared to baseline models.
