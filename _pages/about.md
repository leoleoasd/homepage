Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Yuxuan (Leo) Lu, a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/). I'm currently working as an intern applied scientist at Amazon. 

My current research focus is on <b> developing and leveraging Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents) for simulating human behaviors </b>, including using LLM Agents in usability testing<a class="cite" href="#luUXAgentLLMAgentBased2025a"> [1] </a>, A/B testing<a class="cite" href="#wangAgentAAutomatedScalable2025"> [2] </a>, training LLM Agents towards accurate simulation of human behaviors<a class="cite" href="#luLLMAgentsThat2025"> [3] </a>, and more.

Before starting my Ph.D. program, I got my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology and <b> Graduated with honor </b> at Beijing University of Technology. In the past, I've worked as Machine Learning Researcher at a joint program between **LinkedIn** and **Microsoft Research Asia**. I've also worked as an intern research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) lab, supervised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu(刘知远)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/).

Research Experience
=====
My current research fields includes human-ai collaboration and interaction, especially in the area of Large Language Models (LLMs).

I'm currently working as an intern applied scientist at Amazon.

Before that, I've worked as Machine Learning Researcher at a joint program between LinkedIn and Microsoft Research Asia where I do study about LinkedIn's social network data. I've also worked as an intern research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) lab, supervised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu(刘知远)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). My research area there includes Knowledge Embedding.

Open source communities
=====
I've participated in many open-source communities. I'm the maintainer of the VSCode extension [LaTeX-Utilities](https://github.com/tecosaur/LaTeX-Utilities), and I'm the founder and maintainer of the [EduOJ](https://github.com/eduoj) project. Furthermore, I've contributed to many open-source projects, like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20603), [UniversalOJ](https://github.com/UniversalOJ/UOJ-System), [OI-Wiki](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki/), [nix](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/) and others.

I've participated as mentor and community leader in the Open Source Promotion Plan 2021. All my 3 students successfully finished their projects. I've participated as a student in the OSPP 2020 in the UniversalOJ community, and successfully finished my project.
