Hi! üëãüèª I'm Yuxuan (Leo) Lu, a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University. I'm advised by [Prof. Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/). My research interest includes Human Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing, especially in training, running and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) effiently and effectively. In the past, I've worked as Machine Learning Researcher at a joint program between LinkedIn and Microsoft Research Asia. I've also worked as an intern research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) lab, supervised by [Zhiyuan Liu(ÂàòÁü•Ëøú)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/).

Research Experience
=====
My current research fields includes data annotation and optimizing LLMs.

Before that, I've worked as Machine Learning Researcher at a joint program between LinkedIn and Microsoft Research Asia where I do study about LinkedIn's social network data. I've also worked as an intern research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) lab, supervised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu(ÂàòÁü•Ëøú)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). My research area there includes Knowledge Embedding.

Open source communities
=====
I've participated in many open-source communities. I'm the maintainer of the VSCode extension [LaTeX-Utilities](https://github.com/tecosaur/LaTeX-Utilities), and I'm the founder and maintainer of the [EduOJ](https://github.com/eduoj) project. Furthermore, I've contributed to many open-source projects, like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20603), [UniversalOJ](https://github.com/UniversalOJ/UOJ-System), [OI-Wiki](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki/), [nix](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/) and others.

I've participated as mentor and community leader in the Open Source Promotion Plan 2021. All my 3 students successfully finished their projects. I've participated as a student in the OSPP 2020 in the UniversalOJ community, and successfully finished my project.
