Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Yuxuan (Leo) Lu, a senior undergraduate student at Beijing University of Technology. I'm currently working as an AI Intern at a joint program between LinkedIn & Microsoft Research Asia. My research interest includes Machine Reading Comprehension(MRC), Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) and general Natural Language Processing. I've worked as an intern research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) lab, supervised by [Zhiyuan Liu(刘知远)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/).

I'm currently working as an AI Intern at a joint intern program between LinkedIn & Microsoft Research Asia. My job includes designing, writing & testing AI models. My research area includes the construction and representation of Knowledge Graphs.

Before that, I've worked as an intern research assistant at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) lab, supervised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu(刘知远)](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). My research area here includes Knowledge Embedding.

Open source communities
=====
I've participated in many open-source communities. I'm the maintainer of the VSCode extension [LaTeX-Utilities](https://github.com/tecosaur/LaTeX-Utilities), and I'm the founder and maintainer of the [EduOJ](https://github.com/eduoj) project. Furthermore, I've contributed to many open-source projects, like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20603), [UniversalOJ](https://github.com/UniversalOJ/UOJ-System), [OI-Wiki](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki/), [nix](https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/) and others.

I've participated as mentor and community leader in the Open Source Promotion Plan 2021. All my 3 students successfully finished their projects. I've participated as a student in the OSPP 2020 in the UniversalOJ community, and successfully finished my project.
