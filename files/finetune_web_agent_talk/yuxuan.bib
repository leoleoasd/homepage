  abstract = {In order to train children's ability to ask curiosity-driven questions, previous research has explored designing specific exercises relying on providing semantic and linguistic cues to help formulate such questions. But despite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited as it relies on generating the said cues by hand, which can be a very costly process. In this context, we propose to leverage advances in the natural language processing field (NLP) and investigate the efficiency of using a large language model (LLM) for automating the production of the pedagogical content of a curious question-asking (QA) training. We study generating the said content using the "prompt-based" method that consists of explaining the task to the LLM in natural text. We evaluate the output using human experts annotations and comparisons with hand-generated content. Results suggested indeed the relevance and usefulness of this content. We also conduct a field study in primary school (75 children aged 9-10), where we evaluate children's QA performance when having this training. We compare 3 types of content : 1) hand-generated content that proposes "closed" cues leading to predefined questions; 2) GPT-3-generated content that proposes the same type of cues; 3) GPT-3-generated content that proposes "open" cues leading to several possible questions. We see a similar QA performance between the two "closed" trainings (showing the scalability of the approach using GPT-3), and a better one for participants with the "open" training. These results suggest the efficiency of using LLMs to support children in generating more curious questions, using a natural language prompting approach that affords usability by teachers and other users not specialists of AI techniques. Furthermore, results also show that open-ended content may be more suitable for training curious question-asking skills.},

  abstract = {Business processes in workflows comprise of an ordered sequence of tasks and decisions to accomplish certain business goals. Each decision point requires the input of a decision-maker to distill complex case information and make an optimal decision given their experience, organizational policy, and external contexts. Overlooking some of the essential factors or lack of knowledge can impact the throughput and business outcomes. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end automated decision support system with explanation for business processes. The system uses the proposed process-aware feature engineering methodology that extracts features from process and business data attributes. The system helps a decision-maker to make quick and quality decisions by predicting the decision and providing an explanation of the factors which led to the prediction. We provide offline and online training methods robust to data drift that can also incorporate user feedback. The system also support predictions with live instance data i.e., allow decision-makers to conduct trials on current data instance by modifying its business data attribute values. We evaluate our system on real-world and synthetic datasets and benchmark the performance, achieving an average of 15\% improvement over baselines.},

Whereas the prior work has mostly focused on proposing QA models for this dataset, our aim is to retrieve as well as generate explanation for a given (question, correct answer choice, incorrect answer choices) tuple from this dataset. Our explanation definition is based on certain desiderata, and translates an explanation into a set of positive and negative common-sense properties (aka facts) which not only explain the correct answer choice but also refute the incorrect ones. We human-annotate a first-of-its-kind dataset (called ECQA) of positive and negative properties, as well as free-flow explanations, for 11K QA pairs taken from the CQA dataset. We propose a latent representation based property retrieval model as well as a GPT-2 based property generation model with a novel two step fine-tuning procedure. We also propose a free-flow explanation generation model. Extensive experiments show that our retrieval model beats BM25 baseline by a relative gain of 100\% in F\_1 score, property generation model achieves a respectable F\_1 score of 36.4, and free-flow generation model achieves a similarity score of 61.9, where last two scores are based on a human correlated semantic similarity metric.}

  abstract = {A long-running goal of the clinical NLP community is the extraction of important variables trapped in clinical notes. However, roadblocks have included dataset shift from the general domain and a lack of public clinical corpora and annotations. In this work, we show that large language models, such as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), perform well at zero- and few-shot information extraction from clinical text despite not being trained specifically for the clinical domain. Whereas text classification and generation performance have already been studied extensively in such models, here we additionally demonstrate how to leverage them to tackle a diverse set of NLP tasks which require more structured outputs, including span identification, token-level sequence classification, and relation extraction. Further, due to the dearth of available data to evaluate these systems, we introduce new datasets for benchmarking few-shot clinical information extraction based on a manual re-annotation of the CASI dataset (Moon et al., 2014) for new tasks. On the clinical extraction tasks we studied, the GPT-3 systems significantly outperform existing zero- and few-shot baselines.}

However, while fairness evaluations have become a standard for supervised methods, little is known about the fairness of LLMs as prediction systems. Further, common standard methods for fairness involve access to models weights or are applied during finetuning, which are not applicable in few-shot learning. Do LLMs exhibit prediction biases when used for standard NLP tasks? In this work, we explore the effect of shots, which directly affect the performance of models, on the fairness of LLMs as NLP classification systems. We consider how different shot selection strategies, both existing and new demographically sensitive methods, affect model fairness across three standard fairness datasets. We discuss how future work can include LLM fairness evaluations.},

However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. We propose CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. We show that CoLT5 achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference, achieving SOTA on the long-input SCROLLS benchmark. Moreover, CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.},

  abstract = {The data used to pretrain large language models has a decisive impact on a model's downstream performance, which has led to a large body of work on data selection methods that aim to automatically determine the most suitable data to use for pretraining. Existing data selection methods suffer from slow and computationally expensive processes, a problem amplified by the increasing size of models and of pretraining datasets. Data mixing, on the other hand, reduces the complexity of data selection by grouping data points together and determining sampling probabilities across entire groups. However, data mixing proportions are typically fixed before training and therefore cannot adapt to changing training dynamics. To address these limitations, we develop an efficient algorithm for Online Data Mixing (ODM) that combines elements from both data selection and data mixing. Based on multi-armed bandit algorithms, our online approach optimizes the data mixing proportions during training. Remarkably, our method trains a model that reaches the final perplexity of the next best method with 19{\textbackslash}\% fewer training iterations, and improves performance on the 5-shot MMLU benchmark by 1.9\% relative accuracy, while adding negligible wall-clock time during pretraining.},

Unfortunately, many treatments carry a risk of late effects including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), possibly leading to significant morbidity and mortality. In this paper we describe current knowledge of the cardiotoxicity arising from cancer treatments, outline gaps in knowledge, and indicate directions for future research and guideline development, as discussed during the 2014 Cancer Survivorship Summit organised by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Better knowledge is needed of the late effects of modern systemic treatments and of radiotherapy to critical structures of the heart, including the effect of both radiation dose and volume of the heart exposed. Research elucidating the extent to which treatments interact in causing CVD, and the mechanisms involved, as well as the extent to which treatments may increase CVD indirectly by increasing cardiovascular risk factors is also important. Systematic collection of data relating treatment details to late effects is needed, and great care is needed to obtain valid and generalisable results. Better knowledge of these cardiac effects will contribute to both primary and secondary prevention of late complications where exposure to cardiotoxic treatment is unavoidable. Also surrogate markers would help to identify patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. Evidence-based screening guidelines for CVD following cancer are also needed. Finally, risk prediction models should be developed to guide primary treatment choice and appropriate follow up after cancer treatment.}

We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction design.},

Yet there are still few comparisons involving more than one remote method. This paper presents results from a systematic empirical comparison of three methods for remote usability testing and a conventional laboratory-based think-aloud method. The three remote methods are a remote synchronous condition, where testing is conducted in real time but the test monitor is separated spatially from the test subjects, and two remote asynchronous conditions, where the test monitor and the test subjects are separated both spatially and temporally. The results show that the remote synchronous method is virtually equivalent to the conventional method. Thereby, it has the potential to conveniently involve broader user groups in usability testing and support new development approaches. The asynchronous methods are considerably more time-consuming for the test subjects and identify fewer usability problems, yet they may still be worthwhile.},

However, there are technical access barriers to building experiments online, and web browsers can present problems for consistent timing---an important issue with reaction-time-sensitive measures. For example, to ensure accuracy and test--retest reliability in presentation and response recording, experimenters need a working knowledge of programming languages such as JavaScript. We review some of the previous and current tools for online behavioral research, as well as how well they address the issues of usability and timing. We then present the Gorilla Experiment Builder (gorilla.sc), a fully tooled experiment authoring and deployment platform, designed to resolve many timing issues and make reliable online experimentation open and accessible to a wider range of technical abilities. To demonstrate the platform's aptitude for accessible, reliable, and scalable research, we administered a task with a range of participant groups (primary school children and adults), settings (without supervision, at home, and under supervision, in both schools and public engagement events), equipment (participant's own computer, computer supplied by the researcher), and connection types (personal internet connection, mobile phone 3G/4G). We used a simplified flanker task taken from the attentional network task (Rueda, Posner, \& Rothbart, 2004). We replicated the ``conflict network'' effect in all these populations, demonstrating the platform's capability to run reaction-time-sensitive experiments. Unresolved limitations of running experiments online are then discussed, along with potential solutions and some future features of the platform.},

We evaluate the method by performing domain adaptation in simulation and analyzing the structure of the latent space during adaptation. We then deploy this policy on a KUKA LBR 4+ robot and evaluate its performance on a task of hitting a hockey puck to a target. Our method shows more consistent and stable domain adaptation than the baseline, resulting in better overall performance.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) stand to reshape traditional methods of working with data. While LLMs unlock new and potentially useful ways of interfacing with data, their use in research processes requires methodological and critical evaluation. In this workshop, we seek to gather a community of HCI researchers interested in navigating the responsible integration of LLMs into data work: data collection, processing, and analysis. We aim to create an understanding of how LLMs are being used to work with data in HCI research, and document the early challenges and concerns that have arisen. Together, we will outline a research agenda on using LLMs as research tools to work with data by defining the open empirical and ethical evaluation questions and thus contribute to setting norms in the community. We believe CHI to be the ideal place to address these questions due to the methodologically diverse researcher attendees, the prevalence of HCI research on human interaction with new computing and data paradigms, and the community's sense of ethics and care. Insights from this forum can contribute to other research communities grappling with related questions.},

  abstract = {Generative AI that can produce realistic text, images, and other human-like outputs is currently transforming many different industries. Yet it is not yet known how such tools might influence social science research. I argue Generative AI has the potential to improve survey research, online experiments, automated content analyses, agent-based models, and other techniques commonly used to study human behavior. In the second section of this article, I discuss the many limitations of Generative AI. I examine how bias in the data used to train these tools can negatively impact social science research---as well as a range of other challenges related to ethics, replication, environmental impact, and the proliferation of low-quality research. I conclude by arguing that social scientists can address many of these limitations by creating open-source infrastructure for research on human behavior. Such infrastructure is not only necessary to ensure broad access to high-quality research tools, I argue, but also because the progress of AI will require deeper understanding of the social forces that guide human behavior.}

The tool allows a user interface's expected and actual use to be captured unobtrusively, with any mismatches indicating potential usability problems being highlighted. HUI Analyzer also supports specification and checking of assertions governing a user interface's layout and actual user interaction. Assertions offer a low cost means of detecting usability defects and are intended to be checked iteratively during a user interface's development. Hotspot analysis is a feature that highlights the relative use of GUI components in a form. This is useful in informing form layout, for example to collocate heavily used components thereby reducing unnecessary scrolling or movement. Based on evaluation, we have found HUI Analyzer's performance in detecting usability defects to be comparable to conventional formal user testing. However the time taken by HUI Analyzer to automatically process and analyze user interactions is much less than that for formal user testing.},

However, evaluating the effectiveness of these systems presents a long-standing and complex scientific challenge. This challenge is rooted in the difficulty of assessing a system's overall effectiveness in assisting users to complete tasks through interactive support, and further exacerbated by the substantial variation in user behaviour and preferences. To address this challenge, user simulation emerges as a promising solution. This book focuses on providing a thorough understanding of user simulation techniques designed specifically for evaluation purposes. We begin with a background of information access system evaluation and explore the diverse applications of user simulation. Subsequently, we systematically review the major research progress in user simulation, covering both general frameworks for designing user simulators, utilizing user simulation for evaluation, and specific models and algorithms for simulating user interactions with search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants. Realizing that user simulation is an interdisciplinary research topic, whenever possible, we attempt to establish connections with related fields, including machine learning, dialogue systems, user modeling, and economics. We end the book with a detailed discussion of important future research directions, many of which extend beyond the evaluation of information access systems and are expected to have broader impact on how to evaluate interactive intelligent systems in general.},

However, existing approaches for LLM4Rec often assess performance using restricted sets of candidates, which may not accurately reflect the models' overall ranking capabilities. In this paper, our objective is to investigate the comprehensive ranking capacity of LLMs and propose a two-step grounding framework known as BIGRec (Bi-step Grounding Paradigm for Recommendation). It initially grounds LLMs to the recommendation space by fine-tuning them to generate meaningful tokens for items and subsequently identifies appropriate actual items that correspond to the generated tokens. By conducting extensive experiments on two datasets, we substantiate the superior performance, capacity for handling few-shot scenarios, and versatility across multiple domains exhibited by BIGRec. Furthermore, we observe that the marginal benefits derived from increasing the quantity of training samples are modest for BIGRec, implying that LLMs possess the limited capability to assimilate statistical information, such as popularity and collaborative filtering, due to their robust semantic priors. These findings also underline the efficacy of integrating diverse statistical information into the LLM4Rec framework, thereby pointing towards a potential avenue for future research.

We formalize contextualized rewriting as a seq2seq problem with group alignments, introducing group tag as a solution to model the alignments, identifying extracted summaries through content-based addressing. Results show that our approach significantly outperforms non-contextualized rewriting systems without requiring reinforcement learning, achieving strong improvements on ROUGE scores upon multiple extractive summarizers.}

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains, thereby prompting researchers to explore their potential for use in recommendation systems. Initial attempts have leveraged the exceptional capabilities of LLMs, such as rich knowledge and strong generalization through In-context Learning, which involves phrasing the recommendation task as prompts. Nevertheless, the performance of LLMs in recommendation tasks remains suboptimal due to a substantial disparity between the training tasks for LLMs and recommendation tasks, as well as inadequate recommendation data during pre-training. To bridge the gap, we consider building a Large Recommendation Language Model by tunning LLMs with recommendation data. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective Tuning framework for Aligning LLMs with Recommendation, namely TALLRec. We have demonstrated that the proposed TALLRec framework can significantly enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs in the movie and book domains, even with a limited dataset of fewer than 100 samples. Additionally, the proposed framework is highly efficient and can be executed on a single RTX 3090 with LLaMA-7B. Furthermore, the fine-tuned LLM exhibits robust cross-domain generalization.

This problem is even worse in imbalanced data scenarios, where labels of the positive class take longer to accumulate. We propose an Active Learning (AL) system for datasets with orders of magnitude of class imbalance, in a cold start streaming scenario. We present a computationally efficient Outlier-based Discriminative AL approach (ODAL) and design a novel 3-stage sequence of AL labeling policies where ODAL is used as warm-up. Then, we perform empirical studies in four real world datasets, with various magnitudes of class imbalance. The results show that our method can more quickly reach a high performance model than standard AL policies without ODAL warm-up. Its observed gains over random sampling can reach 80\% and be competitive with policies with an unlimited annotation budget or additional historical data (using just 2\% to 10\% of the labels).},

The QRTEngine can be used to easily develop browser-based online reaction time experiments with accurate timing within current browser capabilities, and it requires only minimal programming skills. After introducing the QRTEngine, we briefly discuss how to create and distribute a Stroop task. Next, we describe a study in which we investigated the timing accuracy of the engine under different processor loads using external chronometry. Finally, we show that the QRTEngine can be used to reproduce classic behavioral effects in three reaction time paradigms: a Stroop task, an attentional blink task, and a masked-priming task. These findings demonstrate that QRTEngine can be used as a tool for conducting online behavioral research even when this requires accurate stimulus presentation times.},

One key question, for example, is whether a given biomedical mechanism is supported by experimental evidence. This can be seen as an NLI problem but there are no directly usable datasets to address this. The main challenge is that manually creating informative negative examples for this task is difficult and expensive. We introduce a novel semi-supervised procedure that bootstraps an NLI dataset from existing biomedical dataset that pairs mechanisms with experimental evidence in abstracts. We generate a range of negative examples using nine strategies that manipulate the structure of the underlying mechanisms both with rules, e.g., flip the roles of the entities in the interaction, and, more importantly, as perturbations via logical constraints in a neuro-logical decoding system. We use this procedure to create a novel dataset for NLI in the biomedical domain, called BioNLI and benchmark two state-of-the-art biomedical classifiers. The best result we obtain is around mid 70s in F1, suggesting the difficulty of the task. Critically, the performance on the different classes of negative examples varies widely, from 97\% F1 on the simple role change negative examples, to barely better than chance on the negative examples generated using neuro-logic decoding.},

Medline, Embase, the Cochrane library and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies on outcomes of gastrectomy in enhanced recovery or fast-track programmes. The primary outcome measure was post-operative duration of hospital stay (LOHS), and secondary outcome measures were selected based inclusion in two or more studies. Statistical analysis was performed using standardized mean difference (SMD) and odds ratio (OR) as the summary statistics. Fourteen studies, totalling 1676 patients with gastric cancer were analysed, including nine randomized trials. LOHS was significantly shorter after ERP when compared with control patients (CON, SMD -1.10, 95\% confidence interval~-1.56 to~-0.65, p~{$<~$}0.001), but with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2~=~93\%, p~{$<~$}0.001). ERP was also associated with reduced serum inflammatory response (CRP: SMD -0.68 (-1.16 to~-0.19), p~=~0.007; IL-6: SMD -0.62 (-0.94 to~-0.29), p~{$<~$}0.001), less weight loss (SMD -0.79 (-1.11 to~-0.46), p~{$<~$}0.001), and lower cost (SMD -1.02 (-1.59 to~-0.45), p~{$<~$}0.001), as well as a trend toward shorter duration of intravenous infusion (SMD -2.70 (-5.35 to~-0.05), p~=~0.05). Inclusion in an ERP was not associated with increased post-operative morbidity (OR 0.83 (0.65 to 1.06), p~=~0.13) or hospital readmission (OR 1.67 (0.88 to 3.19), p~=~0.12).

International Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) guidelines state for partial heart irradiation a "V25Gy {$<$}10\% will be associated with a {$<$}1\% probability of cardiac mortality" in long-term follow-up after RT. We assessed whether women treated with breast/chest wall RT 10-years ago who died of cardiovascular disease (CVD) violated QUANTEC guidelines. MATERIALS/METHODS: A population-based database identified all cardiovascular deaths in women with early-stage breast cancer {$<$}80\,years, treated with adjuvant breast/chest wall RT from 2002 to 2006. Ten-year rate of cardiovascular death was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier method. Patients were matched on a 2:1 basis with controls that did not die of CVD. For left-sided cases, the heart and left anterior descending (LAD) artery were retrospectively delineated. Dose-volume histograms were calculated, and heart V25Gy compared to QUANTEC guidelines. RESULTS: 5249 eligible patients received breast/chest wall RT from 2002 to 2006: 76 (1.4\% at 10-years) died of CVD by June 2015. Forty-two patients received left-sided RT (1.7\% CVD death at 10-years), 34 right-sided RT (1.3\% at 10-years). Heart V25Gy did not exceed 10\% in any left-sided cases. No cardiac dosimetry parameter distinguished left-sided cases from controls. CONCLUSIONS: QUANTEC guidelines were not violated in any patient that died of CVD after left-sided RT. The risk of radiation induced cardiac death at 10-years appears to be very low if MHD is {$<$}3.3\,Gy and maximum LAD dose (EQD23 Gy) is {$<$}45.4\,Gy. Further studies are needed to evaluate heart and LAD constraints in the CT-planning era.},

Active learning, which attempts to mine and annotate unlabeled instances to improve model performance maximally fast, is a common choice for reducing the annotation cost; however, most methods typically ignore class imbalance and either assume access to initial annotated data or require multiple rounds of active learning selection before improving rare classes. We present STENCIL, which utilizes a set of text exemplars and the recently proposed submodular mutual information to select a set of weakly labeled rare-class instances that are then strongly labeled by an annotator. We show that STENCIL improves overall accuracy by \$10{\textbackslash}\%-24{\textbackslash}\%\$ and rare-class F-1 score by \$17{\textbackslash}\%-40{\textbackslash}\%\$ on multiple text classification datasets over common active learning methods within the class-imbalanced cold-start setting.},

  abstract = {State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models often rely on the Microsoft COCO (MS-COCO) dataset for training. This dataset contains annotations provided by human annotators, who typically produce captions averaging around ten tokens. However, this constraint presents a challenge in effectively capturing complex scenes and conveying detailed information. Furthermore, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects. What would happen if we were able to automatically generate longer captions, thereby making them more detailed? Would these captions, evaluated by humans, be more or less representative of the image content compared to the original MS-COCO captions? In this paper, we present a novel approach to address previous challenges by showcasing how captions generated from different SoTA models can be effectively fused, resulting in richer captions. Our proposed method leverages existing models from the literature, eliminating the need for additional training. Instead, it utilizes an image-text based metric to rank the captions generated by SoTA models for a given image. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as the captions generated by our model exhibit higher consistency with human judgment when evaluated on the MS-COCO test set. By combining the strengths of various SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich, informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance opens up new possibilities for generating captions that are more suitable for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.},

  abstract = {Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime{\textregistered}, NBS Presentation{\textregistered}, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists making their own timing validation measurements for their own stimuli and computer configuration.},

This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine --- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

  abstract = {An after-visit summary (AVS) is a summary note given to patients after their clinical visit. It recaps what happened during their clinical visit and guides patients' disease self-management. Studies have shown that a majority of patients found after-visit summaries useful. However, many physicians face excessive workloads and do not have time to write clear and informative summaries. In this paper, we study the problem of automatic generation of after-visit summaries and examine whether those summaries can convey the gist of clinical visits. We report our findings on a new clinical dataset that contains a large number of electronic health record (EHR) notes and their associated summaries. Our results suggest that generation of lay language after-visit summaries remains a challenging task. Crucially, we introduce a feedback mechanism that alerts physicians when an automatic summary fails to capture the important details of the clinical notes or when it contains hallucinated facts that are potentially detrimental to the summary quality. Automatic and human evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in providing writing feedback and supporting physicians.}

Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies to integrate them effectively into software development processes. The rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly influenced various aspects of daily life, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can serve as promising tools to support activities to enhance the usability of software products. This paper presents a study investigating the potential of LLMs to assist practitioners in conducting usability tests. Specifically, we conducted an experiment where LLMs generate usability test tasks. Our goal is to assess whether AI can effectively support evaluators by comparing tasks generated by LLMs to those defined by usability experts. The findings indicate that while LLMs can provide valuable support, effective usability testing still requires human oversight and expert intervention.},

Many documents do not come with descriptive terms, thus requiring humans to generate keywords on-the-fly. The need to automate this kind of task demands the development of keyword extraction systems with the ability to automatically identify keywords within the text. One approach is to resort to machine-learning algorithms. These, however, depend on large annotated text corpora, which are not always available. An alternative solution is to consider an unsupervised approach. In this article, we describe YAKE!, a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Our system does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. To demonstrate the merits and significance of YAKE!, we compare it against ten state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and one supervised method. Experimental results carried out on top of twenty datasets show that YAKE! significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods on texts of different sizes, languages, and domains.},

To address these gaps, this study aims to develop a revised SOR model by incorporating Kahneman's fast and slow thinking theory to investigate the impulse buying of affordable luxury fashion (ALF). Design/methodology/approach The authors use outlet stores at Bicester village (BV) in England as the research context for ALF shopping. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse a survey sample of 633 consumers with a BV shopping experience. Findings The authors find that impulse buying of ALF arises from the interplay of emotional and cognitive factors, as well as a sequential and dual process involving in-store stimuli affecting on-site emotion and in-store browsing. Research limitations/implications This study reveals that brand connection has a significant and negative influence on the relationship between on-site emotion and in-store browsing, advancing the SOR paradigm and reflecting the interactive effect of human emotion and reasoning on the impulse buying of ALF items. Practical implications Insights into consumers' impulse buying offer practical implications for luxury brand management, specifically for ALF outlet retailers and store managers. Originality/value The results suggest a robust sequential effect of on-site emotion towards in-store browsing on impulse buying, providing updated empirical support for Kahneman's theory of System 1 and System 2 thinking.},

Such models open up the possibility of multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about their abilities with other languages. We propose MultiPL-E, a system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We create the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using MultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18 additional programming languages. We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18 languages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using these new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of three state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We find that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several other languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E allow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on model performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation benchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making it straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages.},

We introduce Alloy, a hybrid approach that combines the richness of human judgments with the power of machine algorithms. Alloy supports greater global context through a new "sample and search" crowd pattern which changes the crowd's task from classifying a fixed subset of items to actively sampling and querying the entire dataset. It also improves efficiency through a two phase process in which crowds provide examples to help a machine cluster the head of the distribution, then classify low-confidence examples in the tail. To accomplish this, Alloy introduces a modular "cast and gather" approach which leverages a machine learning backbone to stitch together different types of judgment tasks.},

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in summarizing clinical texts, their application in echo remains underexplored. To address this, we proposed EchoGPT, a dedicated, domain-specific LLM focused on echo report summarization. Methods Adult echo studies conducted at the Mayo Clinic from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, were collected and categorized into two groups: development (all Mayo locations except Arizona) and external validation (Mayo Arizona). We adapted open-source LLMs (Llama-2, MedAlpaca, Zephyr, and Flan-T5) using In-Context Learning (ICL) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning for echo text summarization. The models' performance was assessed both quantitatively with automatic metrics and qualitatively by cardiologists. Results The development dataset included 97,506 reports from 71,717 unique patients, predominantly male (54.3\%), with an average age of 64.1+/-16.1 years. The final split contains 95,506 for training, and 1,000 each for validation and testing. EchoGPT, a QLoRA fine-tuned Llama-2 model, outperformed other LLMs with about 90\% win rates in various metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERT Score, and RadGraph F1 Score), and produced reports comparable to cardiologists in 30 randomly selected cases for qualitative human review (significantly preferred in conciseness (p{$<$} 0.001), with no significant preference in completeness, correctness, and clinical utility). In the external validation set (n=1,000), EchoGPT consistently outperformed fine-tuned Zephyr model across the same automatic metrics (all p {$<$} 0.0001). Conclusions Capable of generating echocardiography reports on par with human experts, EchoGPT could be used to generate draft reports for human review and approval, with significant workflow advantages.},

The intervention group (n\,=\,20) received weekly telephone counseling sessions and used WiFi scales to monitor their weight from weeks 16 to 36 of pregnancy. We compared differences in weight and birth outcomes for the intervention vs. the TAU group (n\,=\,21).ResultsThe intervention and TAU groups did not differ with respect to: gestational weight gain (15.5\,{\textpm}\,5.3 vs. 13.3\,{\textpm}\,6.8\,kg, respectively); proportion gaining above the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommended weight range (83 vs. 70\%); and weight gain from pre-pregnancy weight to 6\,weeks postpartum (4.8\,{\textpm}\,4.6 vs. 3.0\,{\textpm}\,5.5\,kg). Other birth and health outcomes also did not differ.ConclusionA telemedicine intervention designed to decrease logistical burden on participants was not more successful in reducing excessive weight gain during pregnancy as compared to TAU.

  abstract = {Open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various NLP tasks, however, they are still far inferior to API-based models when acting as agents. How to integrate agent ability into general LLMs becomes a crucial and urgent problem. This paper first delivers three key observations: (1) the current agent training corpus is entangled with both formats following and agent reasoning, which significantly shifts from the distribution of its pre-training data; (2) LLMs exhibit different learning speeds on the capabilities required by agent tasks; and (3) current approaches have side-effects when improving agent abilities by introducing hallucinations. Based on the above findings, we propose Agent-FLAN to effectively Fine-tune LANguage models for Agents. Through careful decomposition and redesign of the training corpus, Agent-FLAN enables Llama2-7B to outperform prior best works by 3.5{\textbackslash}\% across various agent evaluation datasets. With comprehensively constructed negative samples, Agent-FLAN greatly alleviates the hallucination issues based on our established evaluation benchmark. Besides, it consistently improves the agent capability of LLMs when scaling model sizes while slightly enhancing the general capability of LLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/InternLM/Agent-FLAN.},

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in various applications. Inspired by the success of GNNs, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to introduce GNNs into session-based recommendation and have achieved significant results. Nevertheless, due to the highly diverse types of potential information in sessions, existing GNNs-based methods perform differently on different session datasets, leading to the need for efficient design of neural networks adapted to various session recommendation scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Automated neural architecture search for Graph-based Session Recommendation, namely AutoGSR, a framework that provides a practical and general solution to automatically find the optimal GNNs-based session recommendation model. In AutoGSR, we propose two novel GNN operations to build an expressive and compact search space. Building upon the search space, we employ a differentiable search algorithm to search for the optimal graph neural architecture. Furthermore, to consider all types of session information together, we propose to learn the item meta knowledge, which acts as a priori knowledge for guiding the optimization of final session representations. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoGSR is able to find effective neural architectures and achieve state-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the neural architecture search for the session-based recommendation.},

  abstract = {We consider the task of text generation in language models with constraints specified in natural language. To this end, we first create a challenging benchmark Cognac that provides as input to the model a topic with example text, along with a constraint on text to be avoided. Unlike prior work, our benchmark contains knowledge-intensive constraints sourced from databases like Wordnet and Wikidata, which allows for straightforward evaluation while striking a balance between broad attribute-level and narrow lexical-level controls. We find that even state-of-the-art language models like GPT-3 fail often on this task, and propose a solution to leverage a language model's own internal knowledge to guide generation. Our method, called CognacGen, first queries the language model to generate guidance terms for a specified topic or constraint, and uses the guidance to modify the model's token generation probabilities. We propose three forms of guidance (binary verifier, top-k tokens, textual example), and employ prefix-tuning approaches to distill the guidance to tackle diverse natural language constraints. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that CognacGen can successfully generalize to unseen instructions and outperform competitive baselines in generating constraint conforming text.},

Our empirical studies demonstrated the adequate quality of generated personas and highlighted the changes in privacy-related applications (e.g., online advertising) caused by different personas.

To tackle these issues, we summarized existing evaluation metrics and developed a comprehensive taxonomy for the research goals and the evaluation of LLM agents in simulating humanoid behavior.

Most existing GUI agents interact with the environment through extracted structured data, which can be notably lengthy (e.g., HTML) and occasionally inaccessible (e.g., on desktops). To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel visual GUI agent -- SeeClick, which only relies on screenshots for task automation. In our preliminary study, we have discovered a key challenge in developing visual GUI agents: GUI grounding -- the capacity to accurately locate screen elements based on instructions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to enhance SeeClick with GUI grounding pre-training and devise a method to automate the curation of GUI grounding data. Along with the efforts above, we have also created ScreenSpot, the first realistic GUI grounding benchmark that encompasses mobile, desktop, and web environments. After pre-training, SeeClick demonstrates significant improvement in ScreenSpot over various baselines. Moreover, comprehensive evaluations on three widely used benchmarks consistently support our finding that advancements in GUI grounding directly correlate with enhanced performance in downstream GUI agent tasks. The model, data and code will be open-sourced.}

  abstract = {Estimating the time of arrival is a crucial task in intelligent transportation systems. Although considerable efforts have been made to solve this problem, most of them decompose a trajectory into several segments and then compute the travel time by integrating the attributes from all segments. The segment view, though being able to depict the local traffic conditions straightforwardly, is insufficient to embody the intrinsic structure of trajectories on the road network. To overcome the limitation, this study proposes multi-view trajectory representation that comprehensively interprets a trajectory from the segment-, link-, and intersection-views. To fulfill the purpose, we design a hierarchical self-attention network (HierETA) that accurately models the local traffic conditions and the underlying trajectory structure. Specifically, a segment encoder is developed to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies at a fine granularity, within which an adaptive self-attention module is designed to boost performance. Further, a joint link-intersection encoder is developed to characterize the natural trajectory structure consisting of alternatively arranged links and intersections. Afterward, a hierarchy-aware attention decoder is designed to realize a tradeoff between the multi-view spatio-temporal features. The hierarchical encoders and the attentive decoder are simultaneously learned to achieve an overall optimality. Experiments on two large-scale practical datasets show the superiority of HierETA over the state-of-the-arts.},

We show that, compared to existing datasets that can be used to generate educational questions, LearningQ (i) covers a wide range of educational topics and (ii) contains long and cognitively demanding documents for which question generation requires reasoning over the relationships between sentences and paragraphs. As a result, a significant percentage of LearningQ questions ({\textasciitilde}30\%) require higher-order cognitive skills to solve (such as applying, analyzing), in contrast to existing question-generation datasets that are designed mostly for the lowest cognitive skill level (i.e. remembering). To understand the effectiveness of existing question generation methods in producing educational questions, we evaluate both rule-based and deep neural network based methods on LearningQ. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art methods which perform well on existing datasets cannot generate useful educational questions. This implies that LearningQ is a challenging test bed for the generation of high-quality educational questions and worth further investigation.

By harnessing multiple advanced abilities of LLMs, including in-context learning, instruction following, and social intelligence, RPLAs achieve a remarkable sense of human likeness and vivid role-playing performance. RPLAs can mimic a wide range of personas, ranging from historical figures and fictional characters to real-life individuals. Consequently, they have catalyzed numerous AI applications, such as emotional companions, interactive video games, personalized assistants and copilots, and digital clones. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the evolution and recent progress in RPLAs integrating with cutting-edge LLM technologies. We categorize personas into three types: 1) Demographic Persona, which leverages statistical stereotypes; 2) Character Persona, focused on well-established figures; and 3) Individualized Persona, customized through ongoing user interactions for personalized services. We begin by presenting a comprehensive overview of current methodologies for RPLAs, followed by the details for each persona type, covering corresponding data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation. Afterward, we discuss the fundamental risks, existing limitations, and future prospects of RPLAs. Additionally, we provide a brief review of RPLAs in AI applications, which reflects practical user demands that shape and drive RPLA research. Through this work, we aim to establish a clear taxonomy of RPLA research and applications, and facilitate future research in this critical and ever-evolving field, and pave the way for a future where humans and RPLAs coexist in harmony.},

In this context, recent news such as "ChatGPT correctly diagnosed a 4-year-old's rare disease after 17 doctors failed" underscore LLMs' potential, yet underexplored, role in clinically diagnosing rare diseases. To bridge this research gap, we introduce RareBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on 4 critical dimensions within the realm of rare diseases. Meanwhile, we have compiled the largest open-source dataset on rare disease patients, establishing a benchmark for future studies in this domain. To facilitate differential diagnosis of rare diseases, we develop a dynamic few-shot prompt methodology, leveraging a comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph synthesized from multiple knowledge bases, significantly enhancing LLMs' diagnostic performance. Moreover, we present an exhaustive comparative study of GPT-4's diagnostic capabilities against those of specialist physicians. Our experimental findings underscore the promising potential of integrating LLMs into the clinical diagnostic process for rare diseases.

  abstract = {Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RMs interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models - Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) - which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism - self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of RM-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9\%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analyses to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six REASRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.},

  abstract = {Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have exhibited great potential in solving single-task sequential decision-making problems with high-dimensional observations and long horizons, but are known to be hard to generalize across tasks. Model-based RL, on the other hand, learns task-agnostic models of the world that naturally enables transfer across different reward functions, but struggles to scale to complex environments due to the compounding error. To get the best of both worlds, we propose a self-supervised reinforcement learning method that enables the transfer of behaviors across tasks with different rewards, while circumventing the challenges of model-based RL. In particular, we show self-supervised pretraining of model-free reinforcement learning with a number of random features as rewards allows implicit modeling of long-horizon environment dynamics. Then, planning techniques like model-predictive control using these implicit models enable fast adaptation to problems with new reward functions. Our method is self-supervised in that it can be trained on offline datasets without reward labels, but can then be quickly deployed on new tasks. We validate that our proposed method enables transfer across tasks on a variety of manipulation and locomotion domains in simulation, opening the door to generalist decision-making agents.},

  abstract = {Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have exhibited great potential in solving single-task sequential decision-making problems with high-dimensional observations and long horizons, but are known to be hard to generalize across tasks. Model-based RL, on the other hand, learns task-agnostic models of the world that naturally enables transfer across different reward functions, but struggles to scale to complex environments due to the compounding error. To get the best of both worlds, we propose a self-supervised reinforcement learning method that enables the transfer of behaviors across tasks with different rewards, while circumventing the challenges of model-based RL. In particular, we show self-supervised pre-training of model-free reinforcement learning with a number of random features as rewards allows implicit modeling of long-horizon environment dynamics. Then, planning techniques like model-predictive control using these implicit models enable fast adaptation to problems with new reward functions. Our method is self-supervised in that it can be trained on offline datasets without reward labels, but can then be quickly deployed on new tasks. We validate that our proposed method enables transfer across tasks on a variety of manipulation and locomotion domains in simulation, opening the door to generalist decision-making agents.},

We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, \${\textbackslash}textbf\{Lion\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}textit\{Evo\${\textbackslash}textbf\{L\}\$ved S\${\textbackslash}textbf\{i\}\$gn M\${\textbackslash}textbf\{o\}\$me\${\textbackslash}textbf\{n\}\$tum\}\$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2\% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3\% \${\textbackslash}textit\{zero-shot\}\$ and 91.1\% \${\textbackslash}textit\{fine-tuning\}\$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2\% and 0.1\%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. The implementation of Lion is publicly available.},

In our work, we propose a novel purchase reason explanation task. To this end, we introduce an LLM-based approach to generate a dataset that consists of textual explanations of why real users make certain purchase decisions. We induce LLMs to explicitly distinguish between the reasons behind purchasing a product and the experience after the purchase in a user review. An automated, LLM-driven evaluation, as well as a small scale human evaluation, confirms the effectiveness of our approach to obtaining high-quality, personalized explanations. We benchmark this dataset on two personalized explanation generation tasks. We release the code and prompts to spur further research.},

  abstract = {Human evaluation is indispensable and inevitable for assessing the quality of texts generated by machine learning models or written by humans. However, human evaluation is very difficult to reproduce and its quality is notoriously unstable, hindering fair comparisons among different natural language processing (NLP) models and algorithms. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on unseen tasks when only the task instructions are provided. In this paper, we explore if such an ability of the LLMs can be used as an alternative to human evaluation. We present the LLMs with the exact same instructions, samples to be evaluated, and questions used to conduct human evaluation, and then ask the LLMs to generate responses to those questions; we dub this LLM evaluation. We use human evaluation and LLM evaluation to evaluate the texts in two NLP tasks: open-ended story generation and adversarial attacks. We show that the result of LLM evaluation is consistent with the results obtained by expert human evaluation: the texts rated higher by human experts are also rated higher by the LLMs. We also find that the results of LLM evaluation are stable over different formatting of the task instructions and the sampling algorithm used to generate the answer. We are the first to show the potential of using LLMs to assess the quality of texts and discuss the limitations and ethical considerations of LLM evaluation.},

In addition to helping developers understand the behavior of the program, DemoScript also allows developers to revise their program by interactively manipulating the cross-device storyboard.

We found that despite the best efforts by usability professionals to get familiar with complex domains on their own, the lack of formal domain expertise can be a significant hurdle for carrying out effective usability evaluations. Partnerships with domain experts lead to effective results as long as domain experts are willing to be an integral part of the usability team. These findings suggest that for achieving usability in complex domains, some fundamental educational changes may be needed in the training of usability professionals.},

Their conversational responses must be informed by all available information, and their actions must help to achieve goals. This dichotomy between conversing with the user and doing multi-step reasoning and planning can be seen as analogous to the human systems of "thinking fast and slow" as introduced by Kahneman. Our approach is comprised of a "Talker" agent (System 1) that is fast and intuitive, and tasked with synthesizing the conversational response; and a "Reasoner" agent (System 2) that is slower, more deliberative, and more logical, and is tasked with multi-step reasoning and planning, calling tools, performing actions in the world, and thereby producing the new agent state. We describe the new Talker-Reasoner architecture and discuss its advantages, including modularity and decreased latency. We ground the discussion in the context of a sleep coaching agent, in order to demonstrate real-world relevance.},

To address the computational constraints inherent to smartphones, within LiMAC, we introduce a small Action Transformer (AcT) integrated with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) for real-time decision-making and task execution. We evaluate LiMAC on two open-source mobile control datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our small-form-factor approach against fine-tuned versions of open-source VLMs, such as Florence2 and Qwen2-VL. It also significantly outperforms prompt engineering baselines utilising closed-source foundation models like GPT-4o. More specifically, LiMAC increases the overall action accuracy by up to 19\% compared to fine-tuned VLMs, and up to 42\% compared to prompt-engineering baselines.},

  abstract = {The remarkable success of large language models has been driven by dense models trained on massive unlabeled, unstructured corpora. These corpora typically contain text from diverse, heterogeneous sources, but information about the source of the text is rarely used during training. Transferring their knowledge to a target domain is typically done by continuing training in-domain. In this paper, we introduce a method to permit domain adaptation to many diverse domains using a computationally efficient adapter approach. Our method is based on the observation that textual domains are partially overlapping, and we represent domains as a hierarchical tree structure where each node in the tree is associated with a set of adapter weights. When combined with a frozen pretrained language model, this approach enables parameter sharing among related domains, while avoiding negative interference between unrelated ones. Experimental results with GPT-2 and a large fraction of the 100 most represented websites in C4 show across-the-board improvements in-domain. We additionally provide an inference time algorithm for a held-out domain and show that averaging over multiple paths through the tree enables further gains in generalization, while adding only a marginal cost to inference.}

In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM 540B by a large margin (+9.4\% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2\% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.},

Modern treatment strategies have led to an improvement in the chances of surviving a diagnosis of cancer; however, these gains can come at a cost. Patients may experience adverse cardiovascular events related to their cancer treatment or as a result of an exacerbation of underlying cardiovascular disease. With longer periods of survival, late effects of cancer treatment may become clinically evident years or decades after completion of therapy. Current cancer therapy incorporates multiple agents whose deleterious cardiac effects may be additive or synergistic. Cardiac dysfunction may result from agents that can result in myocyte destruction, such as with anthracycline use, or from agents that appear to transiently affect left ventricular contractility. In addition, cancer treatment may be associated with other cardiac events, such as severe treatment-induced hypertension and vasospastic and thromboembolic ischemia, as well as rhythm disturbances, including QTc prolongation, that may be rarely life-threatening. Early and late effects of chest radiation can lead to radiation-induced heart disease, including pericardial disease, myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and arrhythmias, in the setting of myocardial fibrosis. The discipline of cardio-oncology has developed in response to the combined decision making necessary to optimize the care of cancer patients, whether they are receiving active treatment or are long-term survivors. Strategies to prevent or mitigate cardiovascular damage from cancer treatment are needed to provide the best cancer care. This review will focus on the common cardiovascular issues that may arise during or after cancer therapy, the detection and monitoring of cardiovascular injury, and the best management principles to protect against or minimize cardiotoxicity during the spectrum of cancer treatment strategies.

  abstract = {The debut of ChatGPT has recently attracted significant attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community and beyond. Existing studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT shows significant improvement in a range of downstream NLP tasks, but the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in terms of recommendations remain unclear. In this study, we aim to enhance ChatGPT's recommendation capabilities by aligning it with traditional information retrieval (IR) ranking capabilities, including point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise ranking. To achieve this goal, we re-formulate the aforementioned three recommendation policies into prompt formats tailored specifically to the domain at hand. Through extensive experiments on four datasets from different domains, we analyze the distinctions among the three recommendation policies. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT achieves an optimal balance between cost and performance when equipped with list-wise ranking. This research sheds light on a promising direction for aligning ChatGPT with recommendation tasks.

  abstract = {Computationally intensive decoding procedures---including search, reranking, and self-critique---can improve the quality of language model (LM) outputs in problems spanning code generation, numerical reasoning, and dialog. Existing work typically applies the same decoding procedure for every input to an LM. But not all inputs require the same amount of computation to process. Can we allocate decoding computation adaptively, using more resources to answer questions whose answers will be harder to compute? We present an approach that predicts the distribution of rewards given an input and computation budget, then allocates additional computation to inputs for which it is predicted to be most useful. We apply this approach in two decoding procedures: first, an adaptive best-of-k procedure that dynamically selects the number of samples to generate as input to a reranker; second, a routing procedure that dynamically responds to a query using a decoding procedure that is expensive but accurate, or one that is cheaper but less capable. Across a suite of programming, mathematics, and dialog tasks, we show that accurate computation-allocation procedures can be learned, and reduce computation by up to 50\% at no cost to response quality, or improve quality by up to 10\% at a fixed computational budget.},

  abstract = {Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15\% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4\% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1\% accuracy).},

To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks.

Incidentally, in recent years, the machine learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4\% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4\% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5\%) or FLAC (30.3\%), respectively. Finally, we show that the prediction-compression equivalence allows us to use any compressor (like gzip) to build a conditional generative model.},

To develop dialogue agents with unique personas, models are trained to converse given a specific persona, but hand-crafting these persona can be time-consuming, thus methods exist to automatically extract persona information from existing character-specific dialogue. However, these persona-extraction models are also trained on datasets derived from PersonaChat and struggle to provide high-quality persona information from conversational settings that do not take place in the real world, such as the fantasy-focused dataset, LIGHT. Creating new data to train models on a specific setting is human-intensive, thus prohibitively expensive. To address both these issues, we introduce a natural language inference method for post-hoc adapting a trained persona extraction model to a new setting. We draw inspiration from the literature of dialog natural language inference (NLI), and devise NLI-reranking methods to extract structured persona information from dialogue. Compared to existing persona extraction models, our method returns higher-quality extracted persona and requires less human annotation.},

Existing datasets for web agents either use simulated websites or only cover a limited set of websites and tasks, thus not suitable for generalist web agents. With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected from 137 websites spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the tasks, Mind2Web provides three necessary ingredients for building generalist web agents: 1) diverse domains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world websites instead of simulated and simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of user interaction patterns. Based on Mind2Web, we conduct an initial exploration of using large language models (LLMs) for building generalist web agents. While the raw HTML of real-world websites are often too large to be fed to LLMs, we show that first filtering it with a small LM significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solution demonstrates a decent level of performance, even on websites or entire domains the model has never seen before, but there is still a substantial room to improve towards truly generalizable agents. We open-source our dataset, model implementation, and trained models (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web) to facilitate further research on building a generalist agent for the web.},

In this work, we introduce a new task of Conversational Web Navigation, which necessitates sophisticated interactions that span multiple turns with both the users and the environment, supported by a specially developed dataset named Multi-Turn Mind2Web (MT-Mind2Web). To tackle the limited context length of LLMs and the context-dependency issue of the conversational tasks, we further propose a novel framework, named self-reflective memory-augmented planning (Self-MAP), which employs memory utilization and self-reflection techniques.

We develop a procedure for Int8 matrix multiplication for feed-forward and attention projection layers in transformers, which cut the memory needed for inference by half while retaining full precision performance. With our method, a 175B parameter 16/32-bit checkpoint can be loaded, converted to Int8, and used immediately without performance degradation. This is made possible by understanding and working around properties of highly systematic emergent features in transformer language models that dominate attention and transformer predictive performance. To cope with these features, we develop a two-part quantization procedure, LLM.int8(). We first use vector-wise quantization with separate normalization constants for each inner product in the matrix multiplication, to quantize most of the features. However, for the emergent outliers, we also include a new mixed-precision decomposition scheme, which isolates the outlier feature dimensions into a 16-bit matrix multiplication while still more than 99.9\% of values are multiplied in 8-bit. Using LLM.int8(), we show empirically it is possible to perform inference in LLMs with up to 175B parameters without any performance degradation. This result makes such models much more accessible, for example making it possible to use OPT-175B/BLOOM on a single server with consumer GPUs. We open-source our software.},

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.

Our experiments on open-source benchmarks yield extensive results, underscoring HPC-GPT's potential to bridge the performance gap between LLMs and HPC-specific tasks.

  abstract = {Prompt-learning has become a new paradigm in modern natural language processing, which directly adapts pre-trained language models (PLMs) to \$cloze\$-style prediction, autoregressive modeling, or sequence to sequence generation, resulting in promising performances on various tasks. However, no standard implementation framework of prompt-learning is proposed yet, and most existing prompt-learning codebases, often unregulated, only provide limited implementations for specific scenarios. Since there are many details such as templating strategy, initializing strategy, and verbalizing strategy, etc. need to be considered in prompt-learning, practitioners face impediments to quickly adapting the desired prompt learning methods to their applications. In this paper, we present \{OpenPrompt\}, a unified easy-to-use toolkit to conduct prompt-learning over PLMs. OpenPrompt is a research-friendly framework that is equipped with efficiency, modularity, and extendibility, and its combinability allows the freedom to combine different PLMs, task formats, and prompting modules in a unified paradigm. Users could expediently deploy prompt-learning frameworks and evaluate the generalization of them on different NLP tasks without constraints.

It accomplishes this by utilizing distortion techniques and cognitive characteristics. When it comes to countering security attacks, cognitive CAPTCHA methods have proven to be more effective than other approaches. The advancement of eye-tracking technology has greatly improved human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling users to engage with computers without physical contact. This technology is widely used for studying attention, cognitive processes, and performance. In this specific research, we conducted eye-tracking experiments on participants to investigate how their visual behavior changes as the complexity of cognitive CAPTCHAs varies. By analyzing the distribution of eye gaze on each level of CAPTCHA, we can assess users' visual behavior based on eye movement performance and process metrics. The data collected is then employed in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to categorize and examine the relative importance of these factors in predicting performance. This study highlights the potential to enhance any cognitive CAPTCHA model by gaining insights into the underlying cognitive processes.},

The rapid evolution of LLMs presents opportunities for developers to enhance applications continuously. However, this constant adaptation can also lead to performance regressions during model migrations. While several interactive tools have been proposed to streamline the complexity of prompt engineering, few address the specific requirements of regression testing for LLM Migrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce RETAIN (REgression Testing guided LLM migrAtIoN), a tool designed explicitly for regression testing in LLM Migrations. RETAIN comprises two key components: an interactive interface tailored to regression testing needs during LLM migrations, and an error discovery module that facilitates understanding of differences in model behaviors. The error discovery module generates textual descriptions of various errors or differences between model outputs, providing actionable insights for prompt refinement. Our automatic evaluation and empirical user studies demonstrate that RETAIN, when compared to manual evaluation, enabled participants to identify twice as many errors, facilitated experimentation with 75\% more prompts, and achieves 12\% higher metric scores in a given time frame.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing success of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in real-world applications, their maintenance over time remains challenging. In particular, the prediction accuracy of deployed ML models can suffer due to significant changes between training and serving data over time, known as data drift. Traditional data drift solutions primarily focus on detecting drift, and then retraining the ML models, but do not discern whether the detected drift is harmful to model performance. In this paper, we observe that not all data drifts lead to degradation in prediction accuracy. We then introduce a novel approach for identifying portions of data distributions in serving data where drift can be potentially harmful to model performance, which we term Data Distributions with Low Accuracy (DDLA). Our approach, using decision trees, precisely pinpoints low-accuracy zones within ML models, especially Blackbox models. By focusing on these DDLAs, we effectively assess the impact of data drift on model performance and make informed decisions in the ML pipeline. In contrast to existing data drift techniques, we advocate for model retraining only in cases of harmful drifts that detrimentally affect model performance. Through extensive experimental evaluations on various datasets and models, our findings demonstrate that our approach significantly improves cost-efficiency over baselines, while achieving comparable accuracy.}

  abstract = {Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to interact with external environments (e.g., games, APIs, world models) to solve user-provided tasks. However, current frameworks often lack the ability to collaborate effectively with users in fully conversational settings. Conversations are essential for aligning on task details, achieving user-defined goals, and satisfying preferences. While existing agents address ambiguity through clarification questions, they underutilize the broader potential of an LLM's conversational capabilities. In this work, we introduce ReSpAct, an LLM-based agent designed to seamlessly integrate reasoning, decision-making, and dynamic dialogue for task-solving. Expanding on reasoning-first approaches like ReAct, ReSpAct employs active, free-flowing dialogues to interpret instructions, clarify goals, provide status updates, resolve subtask failures, and refine plans based on user inputs without any explicit dialogue schema. By alternating between task-solving actions and interactive conversations, ReSpAct demonstrates improved performance across diverse environments. We evaluate ReSpAct in user-interactive settings, including task-oriented dialogue systems (MultiWOZ) and decision-making tasks (ALFWorld, WebShop). ReSpAct outperforms ReAct with absolute success rate improvements of 6\% and 4\% in ALFWorld and WebShop, respectively, and achieves a 5.5\% gain in Inform and a 3\% gain in Success scores in MultiWOZ. These results highlight the value of integrating dynamic user-agent collaboration for more effective task resolution.},

The underlying machine learning model highlights ambiguity and inconsistency. Our goal was not to reduce qualitative coding to a machine-solvable problem, but rather to bolster human understanding gained from coding and reinterpreting the data collaboratively. We conducted an experimental study with 39 participants who coded tweets using our interface. In addition to increased understanding of the topic, participants reported that Aeonium's collaborative coding functionality helped them reflect on their own interpretations. Feedback from participants demonstrates that visual analytics can help facilitate rich qualitative analysis and suggests design implications for future exploration.},

In this paper, we propose a novel model called BioBERTSum to better capture token-level and sentence-level contextual representation, which uses a domain-aware bidirectional language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora as encoder, and further fine-tunes the language model for extractive text summarization task on single biomedical document. Especially, we adopt a sentence position embedding mechanism, which enables the model to learn the position information of sentences and achieve the structural feature of document. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use the pre-trained language model and fine-tuning strategy for extractive summarization task in the biomedical domain.

We propose a General Language Model (GLM) based on autoregressive blank infilling to address this challenge. GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25{\textbackslash}mbox\${\textbackslash}times\$ parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability to different downstream tasks.}

We propose a Hierarchical Question-Aware Context Learning (HQACL) model for the biomedical QA task constituted by multi-level attention. The interaction between the question and the context can be captured layer by layer, with multigrained embeddings to strengthen the ability of the language representation. A special training method called DA, including two parts namely domain adaptation and data augmentation, is also introduced to enhance the model performance. Domain adaptation can be defined as pre-training on a large-scale opendomain dataset and fine-tuning on the small training set of the target domain. As for the data augmentation, the Round-trip translation method is adopted to create new data with various expressions, which almost doubles the training set.

To ensure intuitive and easy usability, the GUIs need to be tested, where developers aim at finding possible bugs and inconsistent functionality. Manual GUI testing requires time and effort, and thus, its efficiency can be improved with automation. Conventional automation tools for GUI testing reduce the burden of manual testing but also introduce challenges in the maintenance of test cases. In order to overcome these issues, we propose a deep-reinforcement-learning-based (DRL) solution for automated and adaptive GUI testing. Specifically, we propose and evaluate the performance of an image-based DRL solution. We adapt the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm to GUI testing inspired by how a human uses a GUI. We feed screenshots of the GUI as the input and let the algorithm decide how to interact with GUI components. We observe that our solution can achieve up to six times higher exploration efficiency compared to selected baseline algorithms. Moreover, our solution is more efficient than inexperienced human users and almost as efficient as an experienced human user in our experimental GUI testing scenario. For these reasons, image-based DRL exploration can be considered as a viable GUI testing method.},

We agree that some of these arguments have force against some of the theories in the literature but believe them to be overstated. We argue that the dual-processing distinction is supported by much recent evidence in cognitive science. Our preferred theoretical approach is one in which rapid autonomous processes (Type 1) are assumed to yield default responses unless intervened on by distinctive higher order reasoning processes (Type 2). What defines the difference is that Type 2 processing supports hypothetical thinking and load heavily on working memory.},

We address the existing shortcomings of summarization evaluation methods along five dimensions: 1) we re-evaluate 14 automatic evaluation metrics in a comprehensive and consistent fashion using neural summarization model outputs along with expert and crowd-sourced human annotations; 2) we consistently benchmark 23 recent summarization models using the aforementioned automatic evaluation metrics; 3) we assemble the largest collection of summaries generated by models trained on the CNN/DailyMail news dataset and share it in a unified format; 4) we implement and share a toolkit that provides an extensible and unified API for evaluating summarization models across a broad range of automatic metrics; and 5) we assemble and share the largest and most diverse, in terms of model types, collection of human judgments of model-generated summaries on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset annotated by both expert judges and crowd-source workers. We hope that this work will help promote a more complete evaluation protocol for text summarization as well as advance research in developing evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgments.}

  abstract = {Agent self-improvement, where the backbone Large Language Model (LLM) of the agent are trained on trajectories sampled autonomously based on their own policies, has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing performance. Recent advancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation: their performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning cycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10\% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models. Our work establishes the necessity of integrating world models into autonomous agent frameworks to unlock sustained adaptability.},

Toward building advanced multimodal AI applications, such as agents that understand complex scenes and navigate through webpages, the skill of multipanel visual reasoning is essential, and a comprehensive evaluation of models in this regard is important. Therefore, we introduce Multipanel Visual Question Answering (MultipanelVQA), a novel benchmark comprising 6,600 triplets of questions, answers, and multipanel images that specifically challenge models in comprehending multipanel images.

Distinctively, the MultipanelVQA benchmark features synthetically generated multipanel images specifically crafted to isolate and assess the impact of various factors, such as the layout, on LVLMs' multipanel image comprehension abilities. As a result, in addition to benchmarking the capabilities of LVLMs in understanding multipanel images, we analyze the potential causes for LVLMs' performance and offer insights for enhancement with the synthetic data.

However, its performance relies heavily on the availability of a large amount of high-quality data. In many real-world situations, data distribution in the target domain may differ significantly from that in the source domain, leading to a significant drop in the performance of RL algorithms. Domain adaptation (DA) strategies have been proposed to address this issue by transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. However, there have been no comprehensive and in-depth studies to evaluate these approaches. In this paper we present a comprehensive and systematic study of DA in RL. We first introduce the basic concepts and formulations of DA in RL and then review the existing DA methods used in RL. Our main objective is to fill the existing literature gap regarding DA in RL. To achieve this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of state-of-the-art DA approaches. We aim to provide comprehensive insights into DA in RL and contribute to advancing knowledge in this field. The existing DA approaches are divided into seven categories based on application domains. The approaches in each category are discussed based on the important data adaptation metrics, and then their key characteristics are described. Finally, challenging issues and future research trends are highlighted to assist researchers in developing innovative improvements.},

We hypothesize that by codifying emergent programming behavior, software engineering interfaces can support a far broader set of developer needs. To explore this idea, we built Codex, a knowledge base that records common practice for the Ruby programming language by indexing over three million lines of popular code. Codex enables new data-driven interfaces for programming systems: statistical linting, identifying code that is unlikely to occur in practice and may constitute a bug; pattern annotation, automatically discovering common programming idioms and annotating them with metadata using expert crowdsourcing; and library generation, constructing a utility package that encapsulates and reflects emergent software practice. We evaluate these applications to find Codex captures a broad swatch of programming practice, statistical linting detects problematic code snippets, and pattern annotation discovers nontrivial idioms such as basic HTTP authentication and database migration templates. Our work suggests that operationalizing practice-driven knowledge in structured domains such as programming can enable a new class of user interfaces.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of {$>$} 12{\textbackslash}\% on ALFWorld and {$>$} 9{\textbackslash}\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.},

In this paper, we define the problem as an aspect extraction task, and propose a novel deep learning model that comprises of three modules: pre-training language model embedding, multi-scale transmission network and contextual summary, which aims to provide an end-to-end solution without any additional supervision. To this end, we adopt BERT to overcome the disadvantage of traditional embedding methods, which cannot combine contextual information. Multi-scale transmission network is proposed to integrate the Bi-GRU and a group of CNN networks to extract sequential and local features of words respectively. Contextual summary is a tailor-made representation distilled from the input sentence, conditioned on each current word, and thus can assist aspect prediction.

To address this, we introduce a Grounded Language Agent for Intelligent Web Interactions, named GLAINTEL. GLAINTEL employs Flan-T5 as its backbone and is flexible in training in various settings: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we tackle both the challenge of learning without human demonstrations and the opportunity to leverage human demonstrations effectively when those are available. Additionally, we explore unsupervised domain adaptation for cases where demonstrations are limited to a specific domain. Experimental evaluations across diverse setups demonstrate the effectiveness of GLAINTEL in unsupervised settings, outperforming in-context learning-based approaches that employ larger models with up to 540 billion parameters. Surprisingly, behavioral cloning-based methods that straightforwardly use human demonstrations do not outperform unsupervised variants of GLAINTEL. Additionally, we show that combining human demonstrations with reinforcement learning-based training yields results comparable to methods utilizing GPT-4.

Moreover, we extend MSCF to the multi-hop architecture. This unified model is called Enhanced Attentive Reader (EA Reader).

Despite the promise, their performance on real-world applications that often involve combinations of tasks is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, called CompWoB -- 50 new compositional web automation tasks reflecting more realistic assumptions. We show that while existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) achieve 94.0\% average success rate on base tasks, their performance degrades to 24.9\% success rate on compositional tasks. On the other hand, transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks) show less generalization gap, dropping from 85.4\% to 54.8\%. By balancing data distribution across tasks, we train a new model, HTML-T5++, that surpasses human-level performance (95.2\%) on MiniWoB, and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB (61.5\%). While these highlight the promise of small-scale finetuned and transferred models for task compositionality, their performance further degrades under different instruction compositions changing combinational order. In contrast to the recent remarkable success of LMA, our benchmark and detailed analysis emphasize the necessity of building LMAs that are robust and generalizable to task compositionality for real-world deployment.},

We propose an instruction-following multimodal agent, WebGUM, that observes both webpage screenshots and HTML pages and outputs web navigation actions, such as click and type. WebGUM is trained by jointly finetuning an instruction-finetuned language model and a vision encoder with temporal and local perception on a large corpus of demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate this recipe improves the agent's ability of grounded multimodal perception, HTML comprehension, and multi-step reasoning, outperforming prior works by a significant margin. On the MiniWoB, we improve over the previous best offline methods by more than 45.8\%, even outperforming online-finetuned SoTA, humans, and GPT-4-based agent. On the WebShop benchmark, our 3-billion-parameter model achieves superior performance to the existing SoTA, PaLM-540B. Furthermore, WebGUM exhibits strong positive transfer to the real-world planning tasks on the Mind2Web. We also collect 347K high-quality demonstrations using our trained models, 38 times larger than prior work, and make them available to promote future research in this direction.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and development of a preliminary qualitative coding tool as well as a method to improve the process of achieving inter-coder reliability (ICR) in small teams. Software applications that support qualitative coding do not sufficiently assist collaboration among coders and overlook some fundamental issues related to ICR. We propose a new dimension of collaborative coding called 'coders' certainty" and demonstrate its ability to illustrate valuable code disagreements that are missing from existing approaches. Through a case study, we describe the utility of our tool, Code Wizard, and how it helped a group of researchers effectively collaborate to code naturalistic observation data. We report the valuable lessons we learned from the development of our tool and method: (1) identifying coders' certainty constitutes an important part of determining the quality of data analysis and facilitates identifying overlapping and ambiguous codes, (2) making the details of coding process visible helps streamline the coding process and leads to a sense of ownership of the research results, and (3) there is valuable information hidden in coding disagreements that can be leveraged for improving the process of data analysis.}

Foundation models are a form of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), and Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm that revolutionizes the deployment and utilization of GenAI models. MaaS represents a paradigm shift in how we use AI technologies and provides a scalable and accessible solution for developers and users to leverage pre-trained AI models without the need for extensive infrastructure or expertise in model training. In this paper, the introduction aims to provide a comprehensive overview of MaaS, its significance, and its implications for various industries. We provide a brief review of the development history of "X-as-a-Service" based on cloud computing and present the key technologies involved in MaaS. The development of GenAI models will become more democratized and flourish. We also review recent application studies of MaaS. Finally, we highlight several challenges and future issues in this promising area. MaaS is a new deployment and service paradigm for different AI-based models. We hope this review will inspire future research in the field of MaaS.},

During the discussion phase, CollabCoder helps to build mutual understanding and productive discussion by sharing coding decision-making information with the team. It also helps to quickly identify agreements and disagreements through quantitative metrics, in order to build a final consensus. During the code grouping phase, CollabCoder employs a top-down approach for primary code group recommendations, reducing the cognitive burden of generating the final codebook.

In this survey, since this is an interdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based modeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios, which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid, covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments.

In this work, we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets, two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future.},

To accommodate the ambiguous, uncertain, and iterative nature of thematic analysis, the use of user-interpretable patterns allows users to understand and validate what the system has learned, make direct fixes, and easily revise, split, or merge previously annotated codes. This new approach also helps human users to learn data characteristics and form new theories in addition to facilitating the ``learning'' of the AI model.

This disconnect makes it challenging to identify the limitations of current models and opportunities for progress. Addressing this limitation, GEM provides an environment in which models can easily be applied to a wide set of tasks and in which evaluation strategies can be tested. Regular updates to the benchmark will help NLG research become more multilingual and evolve the challenge alongside models.

These LAs adapt to specific circumstances and events during the simulation run. They would select tasks to be accomplished among a given set of tasks as the simulation progresses, or synthesize tasks for themselves based on their observations of the environment and on information they may receive from other agents. We investigate an approach in which agents are assigned goals when the simulation starts and then pursue these goals autonomously and adaptively. During the simulation, agents progressively improve their ability to accomplish their goals effectively and safely. Agents learn from their own observations and from the experience of other agents with whom they exchange information. Each LA starts with a given representation of the simulation environment from which it progressively constructs its own internal representation and uses it to make decisions. The paper describes how learning neural networks can support this approach and shows that goal based learning may be used effectively used in this context. An example simulation is presented in which agents represent manned vehicles; they are assigned the goal of traversing a dangerous metropolitan grid safely and rapidly using goal based reinforcement learning with neural networks and compared to three other algorithms.},

To address this issue, grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can be used to control the generation of LMs, guaranteeing that the output follows a given structure. Most existing GCD methods are, however, limited to specific tasks, such as parsing or code generation. In this work, we demonstrate that formal grammars can describe the output space for a much wider range of tasks and argue that GCD can serve as a unified framework for structured NLP tasks in general. For increased flexibility, we introduce input-dependent grammars, which allow the grammar to depend on the input and thus enable the generation of different output structures for different inputs. We then empirically demonstrate the power and flexibility of GCD-enhanced LMs on (1) information extraction, (2) entity disambiguation, and (3) constituency parsing. Our results indicate that grammar-constrained LMs substantially outperform unconstrained LMs or even beat task-specific finetuned models. Grammar constraints thus hold great promise for harnessing off-the-shelf LMs for a wide range of structured NLP tasks, especially where training data is scarce or finetuning is expensive.

Annotating data is however hard to perform and prone to errors, especially when executed manually. This difficulty increases with the amount of data to annotate. Moreover, annotation requires multi-disciplinary collaboration of researchers, with access to heterogeneous and distributed data sources and scientific computations.

Using a sample of 2,382 tweets, we demonstrate that ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance, topics, and frames detection. Specifically, the zero-shot accuracy of ChatGPT exceeds that of crowd-workers for four out of five tasks, while ChatGPT's intercoder agreement exceeds that of both crowd-workers and trained annotators for all tasks. Moreover, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is less than \$0.003 -- about twenty times cheaper than MTurk.

One genre of software, known as Qualitative Data Analysis Software (QDAS or QDA software), is specifically designed to support qualitative research, as opposed to tools primarily used for the collection of data (such as audio or video recorders), or presentation of findings (such as presentation or modeling software). We briefly review the historical development of QDA software---including associated methodological questions and issues---before identifying the increasingly diverse array of expected features and functions in most of the current software programs. We then summarize the ``user experience'' literature and subsequently discuss the boundaries between cadres of qualitative researchers who do use software, and those who do not. Finally, we address potential directions as these programs are being influenced by Web 2.0 developments.},

  abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

  abstract = {We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time-series analysis. Pre-training large models on time-series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time-series repository, and (2) diverse time-series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time-series, called the Time-series Pile, and systematically tackle time-series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time-series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time-series models. Our code is available anonymously at anonymous.4open.science/r/BETT-773F/.},

  abstract = {Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly take pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20\% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.},

What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, \$K+10\$ hidden vectors, before it outputs the \$(K+1){\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) \${\textbackslash}textit\{pause\}\$ token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate \${\textbackslash}textit\{pause-training\}\$ on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of \$18{\textbackslash}\%\$ EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, \$8{\textbackslash}\%\$ on CommonSenseQA and \$1{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k.

This is because personalized predictions require personalized knowledge graphs (KGs), which are difficult to generate from patient EHR data. To address this, we propose GraphCare, an open-world framework that uses external KGs to improve EHR-based predictions. Our method extracts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and external biomedical KGs to build patient-specific KGs, which are then used to train our proposed Bi-attention AugmenTed (BAT) graph neural network (GNN) for healthcare predictions. On two public datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, GraphCare surpasses baselines in four vital healthcare prediction tasks: mortality, readmission, length of stay (LOS), and drug recommendation. On MIMIC-III, it boosts AUROC by 17.6\% and 6.6\% for mortality and readmission, and F1-score by 7.9\% and 10.8\% for LOS and drug recommendation, respectively. Notably, GraphCare demonstrates a substantial edge in scenarios with limited data availability. Our findings highlight the potential of using external KGs in healthcare prediction tasks and demonstrate the promise of GraphCare in generating personalized KGs for promoting personalized medicine.},

Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.},

A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition. To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding \& Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems. While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity. SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors. The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs. In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks. This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session. Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks. These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration.},

Most existing approaches on query recommendation aim to recommend relevant queries, i.e., alternative queries similar to a user's initial query. However, the ultimate goal of query recommendation is to assist users to reformulate queries so that they can accomplish their search task successfully and quickly. Only considering relevance in query recommendation is apparently not directly toward this goal. In this paper, we argue that it is more important to directly recommend queries with high utility, i.e., queries that can better satisfy users' information needs. For this purpose, we attempt to infer query utility from users' sequential search behaviors recorded in their search sessions. Specifically, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network, referred as Query Utility Model (QUM), to capture query utility by simultaneously modeling users' reformulation and click behaviors. We then recommend queries with high utility to help users better accomplish their search tasks. We empirically evaluated the performance of our approach on a publicly released query log by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that, by recommending high utility queries, our approach is far more effective in helping users find relevant search results and thus satisfying their information needs.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong abilities in natural language processing tasks have emerged and have been applied in various kinds of areas such as science, finance and software engineering. However, the capability of LLMs to advance the field of chemistry remains unclear. In this paper, rather than pursuing state-of-the-art performance, we aim to evaluate capabilities of LLMs in a wide range of tasks across the chemistry domain. We identify three key chemistry-related capabilities including understanding, reasoning and explaining to explore in LLMs and establish a benchmark containing eight chemistry tasks. Our analysis draws on widely recognized datasets facilitating a broad exploration of the capacities of LLMs within the context of practical chemistry. Five LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Davinci-003, Llama and Galactica) are evaluated for each chemistry task in zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning settings with carefully selected demonstration examples and specially crafted prompts. Our investigation found that GPT-4 outperformed other models and LLMs exhibit different competitive levels in eight chemistry tasks. In addition to the key findings from the comprehensive benchmark analysis, our work provides insights into the limitation of current LLMs and the impact of in-context learning settings on LLMs' performance across various chemistry tasks.

  abstract = {Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific datasets is a common practice to improve performance on target tasks. However, this performance gain often leads to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in either the task or the characteristics of the training data, resulting in a loss of generalization. This paper introduces Selective Self-Rehearsal (SSR), a fine-tuning approach that achieves performance comparable to the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while improving generalization. SSR leverages the fact that there can be multiple valid responses to a query. By utilizing the model's correct responses, SSR reduces model specialization during the fine-tuning stage. SSR first identifies the correct model responses from the training set by deploying an appropriate LLM as a judge. Then, it fine-tunes the model using the correct model responses and the gold response for the remaining samples. The effectiveness of SSR is demonstrated through experiments on the task of identifying unanswerable queries across various datasets. The results show that standard SFT can lead to an average performance drop of up to 16.7\% on multiple benchmarks, such as MMLU and TruthfulQA. In contrast, SSR results in close to 2\% drop on average, indicating better generalization capabilities compared to standard SFT.},

However, the performance on real-world websites has still suffered from (1) open domainness, (2) limited context length, and (3) lack of inductive bias on HTML. We introduce WebAgent, an LLM-driven agent that learns from self-experience to complete tasks on real websites following natural language instructions. WebAgent plans ahead by decomposing instructions into canonical sub-instructions, summarizes long HTML documents into task-relevant snippets, and acts on websites via Python programs generated from those. We design WebAgent with Flan-U-PaLM, for grounded code generation, and HTML-T5, new pre-trained LLMs for long HTML documents using local and global attention mechanisms and a mixture of long-span denoising objectives, for planning and summarization. We empirically demonstrate that our modular recipe improves the success on real websites by over 50\%, and that HTML-T5 is the best model to solve various HTML understanding tasks; achieving 18.7\% higher success rate than the prior method on MiniWoB web automation benchmark, and SoTA performance on Mind2Web, an offline task planning evaluation.},

However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts.  To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16\% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity.},

In recent years, with the development of knowledge bases and crowdsourcing, high quality large-scale datasets have been proposed by researchers, which has brought a new opportunity for the advance of neural network models and machine reading comprehension. In this survey, an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art research efforts on machine reading comprehension based on neural network is made. First, an overview of machine reading comprehension, including development process, problem formulation, and evaluation metric, is given. Then, a comprehensive review is conducted of related technologies in the most fashionable neural reading comprehension framework including the embedding layer, encoder layer, interaction layer, and output layer as well as the latest BERT pre-training model and its advantages are discussed. After that, this paper concludes the recent research progress of machine reading comprehension datasets and neural reading comprehension model, and gives a comparison and analysis of the most representative datasets and neural network models in detail.

Recent NLP research focuses on classifying, from given text, if an individual is suicidal or clinically healthy. However, there have been no major attempts to differentiate between depression and suicidal ideation, which is a separate and important clinical challenge. Due to the scarce availability of EHR data, suicide notes, or other verified sources, web query data has emerged as a promising alternative. Online sources, such as Reddit, allow for anonymity, prompting honest disclosure of symptoms, making it a plausible source even in a clinical setting. However, online datasets also result in inherent noise in web-scraped labels, which necessitates a noise-removal process to improve performance. Thus, we propose SDCNL, a deep neural network approach for suicide versus depression classification. We utilize online content to train our algorithm, and to verify and correct noisy labels, we propose a novel unsupervised label correction method which, unlike previous work, does not require prior noise distribution information. Our extensive experimentation with various deep word embedding models and classifiers display strong performance of SDCNL as a new clinical application for a challenging problem (We make our supplemental, dataset, web-scraping script, and code (with hyperparameters) available at https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/SDCNL).},

Traditionally, this process is performed manually, but companies often receive thousands of resumes for job applications. In order to reduce the human involvement and errors, many new ways were introduced in this process. This paper discusses about one such process which is very efficient in performing Resume screening.

To improve the user experience and power the products around the social network, Knowledge Graphs (KG) are used as a standard way to extract and organize the knowledge in social networks. This tutorial focuses on how to build KGs for social networks by developing deep NLP models, and holistic optimization of KGs and the social network. Building KG for social networks poses two challenges: 1) input data for each member in the social network is noisy, implicit and in multilingual, so a deep understanding of the input data is needed; 2) KG and the social network influence each other via multiple organic feedback loops, so a holistic view on both networks is needed. We will share the lessons we learned from tackling the above challenges in the past seven years on building the Knowledge Graph for the LinkedIn social network. To address the first challenge of noisy and implicit input data, we present how to train high precision language understanding models by adding small clean data to the noisy data. By doing so, we enhance the-state-of-the-art NLP models such as BERT for building KG. To address multilingual aspect of the input data, we explain how to expand a single-language KG to multilingual KGs by applying transfer learning. For the second challenge of modeling interactions between social network and KG, we launch new products to get explicit feedback on KG from users, and refine KG by learning deep embeddings from the social network. Lastly, we present how we use our KG to empower more than 20+ products at LinkedIn with high business impacts.},

After a discussion about the different dimensions of data availability, we give a structured overview of methods that enable learning when training data is sparse. This includes mechanisms to create additional labeled data like data augmentation and distant supervision as well as transfer learning settings that reduce the need for target supervision.

  abstract = {Scaling up high-quality trajectory data has long been a critical bottleneck for developing human-like computer use agents. We introduce PC Agent-E, an efficient agent training framework that significantly reduces reliance on large-scale human demonstrations. Starting with just 312 human-annotated computer use trajectories, we further improved data quality by synthesizing diverse action decisions with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Trained on these enriched trajectories, our PC Agent-E model achieved a remarkable 141\% relative improvement, surpassing the strong Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking on WindowsAgentArena-V2, an improved benchmark we also released. Furthermore, PC Agent-E demonstrates strong generalizability to different operating systems on OSWorld. Our findings suggest that strong computer use capabilities can be stimulated from a small amount of high-quality trajectory data.},

(1) Data: To gain insights into model behavior in "in-the-wild" conversational recommendation scenarios, we construct a new dataset of recommendation-related conversations by scraping a popular discussion website. This is the largest public real-world conversational recommendation dataset to date. (2) Evaluation: On the new dataset and two existing conversational recommendation datasets, we observe that even without fine-tuning, large language models can outperform existing fine-tuned conversational recommendation models. (3) Analysis: We propose various probing tasks to investigate the mechanisms behind the remarkable performance of large language models in conversational recommendation. We analyze both the large language models' behaviors and the characteristics of the datasets, providing a holistic understanding of the models' effectiveness, limitations and suggesting directions for the design of future conversational recommenders.},

Controlling costs and achieving health care quality improvements require the participation of activated and informed consumers and patients.                                         Objectives.               We describe a process for conceptualizing and operationalizing what it means to be ``activated'' and delineate the process we used to develop a measure for assessing ``activation,'' and the psychometric properties of that measure.                                         Methods.               We used the convergence of the findings from a national expert consensus panel and patient focus groups to define the concept and identify the domains of activation. These domains were operationalized by constructing a large item pool. Items were pilot-tested and initial psychometric analysis performed using Rasch methodology. The third stage refined and extended the measure. The fourth stage used a national probability sample to assess the measure's psychometric performance overall and within different subpopulations.                                         Study Sample.               Convenience samples of patients with and without chronic illness, and a national probability sample (               N               =1,515) are included at different stages in the research.                                         Conclusions.               The Patient Activation Measure is a valid, highly reliable, unidimensional, probabilistic Guttman-like scale that reflects a developmental model of activation. Activation appears to involve four stages: (1) believing the patient role is important, (2) having the confidence and knowledge necessary to take action, (3) actually taking action to maintain and improve one's health, and (4) staying the course even under stress. The measure has good psychometric properties indicating that it can be used at the individual patient level to tailor intervention and assess changes.},

The improved performance of these losses over alternatives, along with further tricks and refinements described in this work, allow for an overall improvement of up to 35\% in terms of MRR and Recall@20 over previous session-based RNN solutions and up to 53\% over classical collaborative filtering approaches. Unlike data augmentation-based improvements, our method does not increase training times significantly. We further demonstrate the performance gain of the RNN over baselines in an online A/B test.},

Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e.g. a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches.},

I demonstrate this approach using OpenAI's GPT3 with experiments derived from Charness and Rabin (2002), Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1986) and Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988). The findings are qualitatively similar to the original results, but it is also trivially easy to try variations that offer fresh insights.

Along this line of research, this work aims to investigate the capacity of LLMs that act as the ranking model for recommender systems. We first formalize the recommendation problem as a conditional ranking task, considering sequential interaction histories as conditions and the items retrieved by other candidate generation models as candidates. To solve the ranking task by LLMs, we carefully design the prompting template and conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets. We show that LLMs have promising zero-shot ranking abilities but (1) struggle to perceive the order of historical interactions, and (2) can be biased by popularity or item positions in the prompts. We demonstrate that these issues can be alleviated using specially designed prompting and bootstrapping strategies. Equipped with these insights, zero-shot LLMs can even challenge conventional recommendation models when ranking candidates are retrieved by multiple candidate generators.

However, agents based on large language models (LLMs) often face substantial planning latency due to two primary factors: the efficiency limitations of the underlying LLMs due to their large size and high demand, and the structural complexity of the agents due to the extensive generation of intermediate thoughts to produce the final output. Given that inefficiency in service provision can undermine the value of automation for users, this paper presents a human-centered efficient agent planning method -- Interactive Speculative Planning -- aiming at enhancing the efficiency of agent planning through both system design and human-AI interaction. Our approach advocates for the co-design of the agent system and user interface, underscoring the importance of an agent system that can fluidly manage user interactions and interruptions. By integrating human interruptions as a fundamental component of the system, we not only make it more user-centric but also expedite the entire process by leveraging human-in-the-loop interactions to provide accurate intermediate steps.

However, current confidence elicitation methods and calibration metrics typically rely on a binary true/false assessment of response correctness. This approach does not apply to long-form generation, where an answer can be partially correct. Addressing this gap, we introduce a unified calibration framework, in which both the correctness of the LLMs' responses and their associated confidence levels are treated as distributions across a range of scores. Within this framework, we develop three metrics to precisely evaluate LLM calibration and further propose two confidence elicitation methods based on self-consistency and self-evaluation. Our experiments, which include long-form QA and summarization tasks, demonstrate that larger models don't necessarily guarantee better calibration, that calibration performance is found to be metric-dependent, and that self-consistency methods excel in factoid datasets. We also find that calibration can be enhanced through techniques such as fine-tuning, integrating relevant source documents, scaling the temperature, and combining self-consistency with self-evaluation. Lastly, we showcase a practical application of our system: selecting and cascading open-source models and ChatGPT to optimize correctness given a limited API budget. This research not only challenges existing notions of LLM calibration but also offers practical methodologies for improving trustworthiness in long-form generation.},

  abstract = {Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate executable actions ({\textbackslash}emph\{e.g.\}, click) and operation boxes step by step. Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models. Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.},

  abstract = {文本问答,旨在构建能够回答任意自然语言问题的计算机系统,是自然语言处理与人工智能领域内最具难度的挑战之一。阅读理解式问答,又称机器阅读理解,是文本问答的一个子任务,在近年来受到学术界和产业界的极大关注。机器阅读理解的目标是教会机器阅读并理解人类语言文本并回答相应问题。由于该任务天然地可以被用来衡量机器自然语言理解能力,因此具有重大的研究价值。此外,阅读理解技术还能被广泛应用于问答应用、搜索引擎以及对话系统中,故具备极强的实用性。近年来,随着大规模阅读理解数据集的发布以及深度学习技术的快速发展,机器阅读理解相关研究取得了令人瞩目的进展。尽管取得了如此成就,却仍然存在许多挑战如:1)当前方法的模型结构和训练方法中存在制约模型性能的问题;2)当前具备顶尖性能的集成模型在实际部署时效率低下;3)传统方法往往是在段落中必须存在答案的假设下设计的,因此无法有效处理无答案问题;4)当前大部分模型是针对单段落场景设计的,故无法有效扩展至开放域问答;5)当前大部分模型无法有效支持离散推理和多答案预测等情况。因此,为了应对上述挑战,本文聚焦机器阅读理解,从注意力机制、训练方法、知识蒸馏、答案验证架构、开放域问答和多类型-多答案预测机制等方面开展若干关键技术研究与实证分析。本文的主要贡献总结如下:第一,针对当前多层注意力架构中的注意力冗余与缺乏问题,以及强化学习训练方法中的收敛抑制问题,提出一个面向抽取式阅读理解的强化助记阅读器,以提升模型性能。该模型在多层注意力架构中引入重关注机制,并在训练时采用动态-评估的强化学习方法来解决上述问题。在阅读理解基准数据集上的实验结果表明,相比之前方法该模型获得了极大的性能提升,我们的集成模型甚至取得了和人类媲美的精确匹配性能。第二,针对知识蒸馏过程中的有偏蒸馏问题,以及无法高效蒸馏中间表示的问题,提出一个面向阅读理解模型压缩的知识蒸馏方法------注意力指导的答案蒸馏方法,以提升模型效率。该方法综合利用标准知识蒸馏、答案蒸馏以及注意力蒸馏来在不降低模型性能的情况下将集成模型压缩为单模型。在三个阅读理解基准数据集上的实验显示,蒸馏后单模型效率得到大幅度提升,且性能甚至在两个数据集上超过了集成模型。第三,针对无答案阅读理解模型的概率互相干扰问题,以及当前方法缺乏一个独立的答案验证阶段的问题,提出一个面向无答案问题的阅读+验证架构,以提高模型对无答案问题的检测精度。该架构包含一个在抽取候选答案的同时检测无答案问题的无答案阅读理解模型,以及一个用来进一步判断预测答案是否正确的答案验证模型。此外,我们引入了两个辅助损失函数来增强阅读理解模型,同时探索了针对答案验证任务的三种网络结构。在斯坦福问答数据集2.0版上的实验显示,该架构在面对无答案问题时的检测精度得到显著提升。第四,针对当前流水线方法面临的训练-测试不一致和重复编码问题,提出一个面向开放域问答的检索-阅读-重排序网络,以提高开放域问答系统性能。该模型包含一个早期停止的检索器、一个远程监督的阅读器、以及一个跨度级答案重排器。这些组件被集成到一个统一的神经网络中以便进行端到端训练来缓解训练-测试不一致问题。另外,编码表示能在多个组件之间被复用以避免重复编码。在四个开放域问答数据集上的实验显示,该模型相比流水线方法性能更优,同时效率更高。第五,针对当前离散推理阅读理解模型面临的答案类型覆盖不全、无法支持多答案预测以及孤立预测算术表达式等问题,提出一个面向离散推理阅读理解的多类型-多跨度网络,以提高在离散推理场景下的模型表现。该模型使用一个多类型答案预测器以支持对四种答案类型的预测,采用一个多跨度抽取方法以动态地抽取指定个数的文本跨度,并使用一个算术表达式重排名机制来对若干候选表达式进行排序以进一步确定预测。在离散推理阅读理解基准数据集上的实验表明,该模型显著提高了答案类型覆盖度和多答案预测精度,因此相比之前方法性能获得了大幅度提升。},

  abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

  abstract = {Modern autonomous driving system is characterized as modular tasks in sequential order, i.e., perception, prediction, and planning. In order to perform a wide diversity of tasks and achieve advanced-level intelligence, contemporary approaches either deploy standalone models for individual tasks, or design a multi-task paradigm with separate heads. However, they might suffer from accumulative errors or deficient task coordination. Instead, we argue that a favorable framework should be devised and optimized in pursuit of the ultimate goal, i.e., planning of the self-driving car. Oriented at this, we revisit the key components within perception and prediction, and prioritize the tasks such that all these tasks contribute to planning. We introduce Unified Autonomous Driving (UniAD), a comprehensive framework up-to-date that incorporates full-stack driving tasks in one network. It is exquisitely devised to leverage advantages of each module, and provide complementary feature abstractions for agent interaction from a global perspective. Tasks are communicated with unified query interfaces to facilitate each other toward planning. We instantiate UniAD on the challenging nuScenes benchmark. With extensive ablations, the effectiveness of using such a philosophy is proven by substantially outperforming previous state-of-the-arts in all aspects. Code and models are public.},

We conduct experiments in the agent self-improving benchmark, OpenWebVoyager, and demonstrate that distilling salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can substantially enhance its performance. Our approach yields significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including WebVoyager, Mind2web-live, and SimpleQA (web search), highlighting the potential of targeted reasoning skill enhancement for web agents.},

This paper presents a framework for simulating daily human activity patterns in home environments at scale, supporting manual configurability of different personas or activity patterns, variation of activity timings, and testing on multiple home layouts. We introduce a method for specifying day-to-day variation in schedules and present a bidirectional constraint propagation algorithm for generating schedules from templates. We validate the expressive power of our framework through a use case scenario analysis and demonstrate that our method can be used to generate data closely resembling human behavior from three public datasets and a self-collected dataset. Our contribution supports systematic testing of social robot behaviors at scale, enables procedural generation of synthetic datasets of human movement in different households, and can help minimize bias in training data, leading to more robust and effective robots for home environments.},

  abstract = {Overparameterized deep networks have the capacity to memorize training data with zero {\textbackslash}emph\{training error\}. Even after memorization, the {\textbackslash}emph\{training loss\} continues to approach zero, making the model overconfident and the test performance degraded. Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid zero training loss, it is hard to tune their hyperparameters in order to maintain a fixed/preset level of training loss. We propose a direct solution called {\textbackslash}emph\{flooding\} that intentionally prevents further reduction of the training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the {\textbackslash}emph\{flood level\}. Our approach makes the loss float around the flood level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the flood level. This can be implemented with one line of code and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers. With flooding, the model will continue to "random walk" with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization. We experimentally show that flooding improves performance and, as a byproduct, induces a double descent curve of the test loss.},

However, these models are trained using next-token prediction, which ignores the syntax and semantics of code. We propose RLCF, that further trains a pre-trained LLM via reinforcement learning, using feedback from a grounding function that scores the quality of the code. The grounding function uses (i) compiler-derived feedback on whether the code it generates passes a set of correctness checks; and (ii) feedback from a different LLM that compares the generated code to a reference code. RLCF is model- and language-agnostic. We empirically evaluate it on the MBJP and MathQA tasks for Java. Our experiments show that RLCF raises the odds that an LLM-generated program compiles, is executable, and produces the right output on tests, often allowing LLMs to match the performance of 2x-8x larger LLMs.},

In addition to improving predictive performance, these are often touted as affording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distribution over attended-to input units, and this is often presented (at least implicitly) as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful ``explanations'' for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be treated as though they do.},

However, because no model is perfect, they still fail to provide appropriate answers in many cases. In this paper, we ask the question, ``How can we know when language models know, with confidence, the answer to a particular query?'' We examine this question from the point of view of calibration, the property of a probabilistic model's predicted probabilities actually being well correlated with the probabilities of correctness. We examine three strong generative models---T5, BART, and GPT-2---and study whether their probabilities on QA tasks are well calibrated, finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability modification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on a diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We also perform analysis to study the strengths and limitations of these methods, shedding light on further improvements that may be made in methods for calibrating LMs. We have released the code at https://github.com/jzbjyb/lm-calibration.}

  abstract = {Despite the many use cases for large language models (LLMs) in creating personalized chatbots, there has been limited research on evaluating the extent to which the behaviors of personalized LLMs accurately and consistently reflect specific personality traits. We consider studying the behavior of LLM-based agents which we refer to as LLM personas and present a case study with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to investigate whether LLMs can generate content that aligns with their assigned personality profiles. To this end, we simulate distinct LLM personas based on the Big Five personality model, have them complete the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality test and a story writing task, and then assess their essays with automatic and human evaluations. Results show that LLM personas' self-reported BFI scores are consistent with their designated personality types, with large effect sizes observed across five traits. Additionally, LLM personas' writings have emerging representative linguistic patterns for personality traits when compared with a human writing corpus. Furthermore, human evaluation shows that humans can perceive some personality traits with an accuracy of up to 80\%. Interestingly, the accuracy drops significantly when the annotators were informed of AI authorship.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for automating complex real-world tasks. To make progress on these difficult tasks, LM agent architectures have become increasingly complex, often incorporating multi-step retrieval tools, multiple agents, and scaffolding adapted to the underlying LM. In this work, we investigate whether all of this complexity is necessary, or if parts of these scaffolds can be removed on challenging tasks like SWE-bench. We show that in the case of SWE-bench, simply putting the entire environment into the context of a long context language model (LCLM) and properly prompting the model makes it competitive with carefully tuned, complex agent scaffolds. We show that a Gemini-1.5-Pro model without any scaffolding or tools achieves 38\% on SWE-Bench-Verified, comparable with approaches using carefully tuned agent scaffolds (32\%). While the unscaffolded approach with Gemini-1.5-Pro falls short of the strongest agentic architectures, we demonstrate that the more capable Gemini-2.5-Pro using the same unscaffolded approach directly attains a 50.8\% solve rate. Additionally, a two-stage approach combining Gemini-1.5-Pro with Claude-3.7 achieves a competitive 48.6\% solve rate.},

This survey begins with a review of the taxonomy of hallucinations and their negative impact on LLM reliability in critical applications. Then, through historical examples and recent relevant theories, the survey explores the potential creative benefits of hallucinations in LLMs. To elucidate the value and evaluation criteria of this connection, we delve into the definitions and assessment methods of creativity. Following the framework of divergent and convergent thinking phases, the survey systematically reviews the literature on transforming and harnessing hallucinations for creativity in LLMs. Finally, the survey discusses future research directions, emphasizing the need to further explore and refine the application of hallucinations in creative processes within LLMs.},

For multi-source knowledge, unlike existing methods that mainly focus on entity-centric knowledge, CogKGE also supports the representations of event-centric, commonsense and linguistic knowledge. For heterogeneous knowledge, besides structured triple facts, CogKGE leverages additional unstructured information, such as text descriptions, node types and temporal information, to enhance the meaning of embeddings. Designing CogKGE aims to provide a unified programming framework for KGE tasks and a series of knowledge representations for downstream tasks. As a research framework, CogKGE consists of five parts, including core, data, model, knowledge and adapter module. As a knowledge discovery toolkit, CogKGE provides pre-trained embedders to discover new facts, cluster entities and check facts. Furthermore, we construct two benchmark datasets for further research on multi-source heterogeneous KGE tasks: EventKG240K and CogNet360K. We also release an online system to discover knowledge visually. Source code, datasets and pre-trained embeddings are publicly available at GitHub, with a short instruction video.}

  abstract = {Active learning (AL) aims to select valuable samples for labeling from an unlabeled sample pool to build a training dataset with minimal annotation cost. Traditional methods always require partially and initially labeled samples to start active selection and then query annotations of samples incrementally through several iterations. However, this scheme is not effective in the deep learning scenario. On the one hand, initially labeled sample sets are not always available in the beginning. On the other hand, the performance of the traditional model is usually poor in the early iterations due to limited training feedback. For the first time, we propose a cold-start AL model based on representative (CALR) sampling, which selects valuable samples without the need for an initial labeled set or the iterative feedback of the target models. Experiments on three image classification datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Caltech-256, showed that CALR achieved a new state-of-the-art performance of AL in cold-start settings. Especially in low annotation budget conditions, our method can achieve up to a 10\% performance increase compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, CALR can be combined with warm-start methods to improve the start-up efficiency while further breaking the performance ceiling of AL, which makes CALR have a broader application scenario.}

Addressing this, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Planning (RAP) framework, designed to dynamically leverage past experiences corresponding to the current situation and context, thereby enhancing agents' planning capabilities. RAP distinguishes itself by being versatile: it excels in both text-only and multimodal environments, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate RAP's effectiveness, where it achieves SOTA performance in textual scenarios and notably enhances multimodal LLM agents' performance for embodied tasks. These results highlight RAP's potential in advancing the functionality and applicability of LLM agents in complex, real-world applications.},

Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget.

  abstract = {For decades, human-computer interaction has fundamentally been manual. Even today, almost all productive work done on the computer necessitates human input at every step. Autonomous virtual agents represent an exciting step in automating many of these menial tasks. Virtual agents would empower users with limited technical proficiency to harness the full possibilities of computer systems. They could also enable the efficient streamlining of numerous computer tasks, ranging from calendar management to complex travel bookings, with minimal human intervention. In this paper, we introduce OmniACT, the first-of-a-kind dataset and benchmark for assessing an agent's capability to generate executable programs to accomplish computer tasks. Our scope extends beyond traditional web automation, covering a diverse range of desktop applications. The dataset consists of fundamental tasks such as "Play the next song", as well as longer horizon tasks such as "Send an email to John Doe mentioning the time and place to meet". Specifically, given a pair of screen image and a visually-grounded natural language task, the goal is to generate a script capable of fully executing the task. We run several strong baseline language model agents on our benchmark. The strongest baseline, GPT-4, performs the best on our benchmark However, its performance level still reaches only 15\% of the human proficiency in generating executable scripts capable of completing the task, demonstrating the challenge of our task for conventional web agents. Our benchmark provides a platform to measure and evaluate the progress of language model agents in automating computer tasks and motivates future work towards building multimodal models that bridge large language models and the visual grounding of computer screens.},

A number of experiments have been conducted in two online settings: retail banking and mobile networks. Based on an extensive video analysis, we have captured four process-related dimensions (number of cycles, duration, number of alternatives and number of criteria) using a business process modelling approach. Significant differences in all process-related dimensions were found across the four archetypes. The study improves understanding of the different types of online consumers and their process outcomes. The findings are useful for online retailers seeking to improve the way they support the four archetypes of online shoppers throughout the decision-making purchasing process.},

  abstract = {Entity resolution (ER) is the task of identifying different representations of the same real-world entities across databases. It is a key step for knowledge base creation and text mining. Recent adaptation of deep learning methods for ER mitigates the need for dataset-specific feature engineering by constructing distributed representations of entity records. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance over benchmark data, they require large amounts of labeled data, which are typically unavailable in realistic ER applications. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based method that targets low-resource settings for ER through a novel combination of transfer learning and active learning. We design an architecture that allows us to learn a transferable model from a high-resource setting to a low-resource one. To further adapt to the target dataset, we incorporate active learning that carefully selects a few informative examples to fine-tune the transferred model. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves comparable, if not better, performance compared to state-of-the-art learning-based methods while using an order of magnitude fewer labels.}

However, PTMs used in previous works usually adopt language modeling as pre-training tasks, lacking task-specific prior segmentation knowledge and ignoring the discrepancy between pre-training tasks and downstream CWS tasks. In this paper, we propose a CWS-specific pre-trained model MetaSeg, which employs a unified architecture and incorporates meta learning algorithm into a multi-criteria pre-training task. Empirical results show that MetaSeg could utilize common prior segmentation knowledge from different existing criteria and alleviate the discrepancy between pre-trained models and downstream CWS tasks. Besides, MetaSeg can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on twelve widely-used CWS datasets and significantly improve model performance in low-resource settings.}

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing healthcare and the practice of medicine as data-driven science and machine-learning technologies, in particular, are contributing to a variety of medical and clinical tasks. Such advancements have also raised many questions, especially about public trust. As a response to these concerns there has been a concentrated effort from public bodies, policy-makers and technology companies leading the way in AI to address what is identified as a "public trust deficit". This paper argues that a focus on trust as the basis upon which a relationship between this new technology and the public is built is, at best, ineffective, at worst, inappropriate or even dangerous, as it diverts attention from what is actually needed to actively warrant trust. Instead of agonising about how to facilitate trust, a type of relationship which can leave those trusting vulnerable and exposed, we argue that efforts should be focused on the difficult and dynamic process of ensuring reliance underwritten by strong legal and regulatory frameworks. From there, trust could emerge but not merely as a means to an end. Instead, as something to work in practice towards; that is, the deserved result of an ongoing ethical relationship where there is the appropriate, enforceable and reliable regulatory infrastructure in place for problems, challenges and power asymmetries to be continuously accounted for and appropriately redressed.},

Findings from our design ethnography reveal four thematic qualities of their relationships to thingcare: Care Spectacle, Care Liminality, Ontological Braiding, and Care Condition. Using these themes as touchstones, we co-speculated to produce four speculative IoT concepts to explore what care as a design ethic might look like for IoT and reflect on nascent opportunities and challenges for domestic IoT design.

With the extracted intents, we train our intent predictor to predict the next intent given the agent's past observations and actions. In particular, we propose a self-exploration approach where top-k probable intent predictions are provided as a hint to the pre-trained LLM agent, which leads to enhanced decision-making capabilities.

This paper presents an effective methodology for constructing domain-specific datasets using domain-specific corpora, thus overcoming the challenges posed by linguistic and cultural differences in non-English-speaking regions. By leveraging mining techniques, this methodology facilitates the construction of datasets tailored to local languages and cultures. A Korean medical corpus served as the foundation for dataset construction, leading to the development of a medical language model that demonstrated high performance and versatility across various NLP tasks. A bidirectional encoder representation from transformer-based comparative analysis revealed comparable performance. The objective is to streamline LLM applications across diverse domains, thereby enhancing language model efficiency. In the future, our efforts will be directed towards implementing the proposed methodology across diverse domains and investigating strategies for extracting domain-specific tasks and vocabulary to enhance the quality of domain datasets.},

In health applications, grounding and interpreting domain-specific and non-linguistic data is important. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs to deliver multi-modal health predictions based on contextual information (e.g. user demographics, health knowledge) and physiological data (e.g. resting heart rate, sleep minutes). We present a comprehensive evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs with diverse prompting and fine-tuning techniques on six public health datasets (PM-Data, LifeSnaps, GLOBEM, AW\_FB, MIT-BIH \& MIMIC-III). Our experiments cover thirteen consumer health prediction tasks in mental health, activity, metabolic, sleep, and cardiac assessment. Our fine-tuned model, Health-Alpaca exhibits comparable performance to larger models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), achieving the best performance in 5 out of 13 tasks. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of context enhancement strategies, and generalization capability of the fine-tuned models across training datasets and the size of training samples. Notably, we observe that our context enhancement can yield up to 23.8\% improvement in performance. While constructing contextually rich prompts (combining user context, health knowledge and temporal information) exhibits synergistic improvement, the inclusion of health knowledge context in prompts significantly enhances overall performance.},

Ideally, such agents should be able to solve new computer tasks presented to them through natural language commands. However, previous approaches to this problem require large amounts of expert demonstrations and task-specific reward functions, both of which are impractical for new tasks. In this work, we show that a pre-trained large language model (LLM) agent can execute computer tasks guided by natural language using a simple prompting scheme where the agent Recursively Criticizes and Improves its output (RCI). The RCI approach significantly outperforms existing LLM methods for automating computer tasks and surpasses supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on the MiniWoB++ benchmark. We compare multiple LLMs and find that RCI with the InstructGPT-3+RLHF LLM is state-of-the-art on MiniWoB++, using only a handful of demonstrations per task rather than tens of thousands, and without a task-specific reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate RCI prompting's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities on a suite of natural language reasoning tasks, outperforming chain of thought (CoT) prompting with external feedback. We find that RCI combined with CoT performs better than either separately. Our code can be found here: https://github.com/posgnu/rci-agent.},

To address these challenges, we propose RaDA, a novel planning method for Web agents that does not require manual exemplars, efficiently leverages the LLMs' context, and enhances generalization. RaDA disentangles planning into two stages: for a new given task, during Retrieval-augmented Task Decomposition (RaD), it decomposes tasks into high-level subtasks; next, during Retrieval-augmented Action Generation (RaA), it traverses the trajectory obtained with RaD to iteratively synthesize actions based on dynamically retrieved exemplars. We compare RaDA with strong baselines covering a broad space of design choices, using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as backbones; and we find consistent improvements over previous SOTA in two challenging benchmarks, CompWoB and Mind2Web, covering settings with different complexities. We show the contributions of RaDA via ablation studies and qualitative analysis; and we discuss the structural benefits of our more compositional design.}

We conduct experiments on four different text classification tasks and show SG-ICL significantly outperforms zero-shot learning and is generally worth approximately 0.6 gold training samples. Moreover, our generated demonstrations show more consistent performance with low variance compared to randomly selected demonstrations from the training dataset.},

To encourage progress on deeper comprehension of language, we present a new dataset and set of tasks in which the reader must answer questions about stories by reading entire books or movie scripts. These tasks are designed so that successfully answering their questions requires understanding the underlying narrative rather than relying on shallow pattern matching or salience.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualWebArena, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of multimodal web agents on *realistic visually grounded tasks*. VisualWebArena comprises of a set of diverse and complex web-based tasks that evaluate various capabilities of autonomous multimodal agents. To perform on this benchmark, agents need to accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based autonomous agents, including several multimodal models. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify several limitations of text-only LLM agents, and reveal gaps in the capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal language agents. VisualWebArena provides a framework for evaluating multimodal autonomous language agents, and offers insights towards building stronger autonomous agents for the web.}

Our method introduces two types of regularization for better calibration: (1) On-manifold regularization, which generates pseudo on-manifold samples through interpolation within the data manifold. Augmented training with these pseudo samples imposes a smoothness regularization to improve in-distribution calibration. (2) Off-manifold regularization, which encourages the model to output uniform distributions for pseudo off-manifold samples to address the over-confidence issue for OOD data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing calibration methods for text classification in terms of expectation calibration error, misclassification detection, and OOD detection on six datasets.

In this task, a system is given a set of hypotheses (such as ``Some obligations of Agreement may survive termination.'') and a contract, and it is asked to classify whether each hypothesis is ``entailed by'', ``contradicting to'' or ``not mentioned by'' (neutral to) the contract as well as identifying ``evidence'' for the decision as spans in the contract. We annotated and release the largest corpus to date consisting of 607 annotated contracts. We then show that existing models fail badly on our task and introduce a strong baseline, which (a) models evidence identification as multi-label classification over spans instead of trying to predict start and end tokens, and (b) employs more sophisticated context segmentation for dealing with long documents. We also show that linguistic characteristics of contracts, such as negations by exceptions, are contributing to the difficulty of this task and that there is much room for improvement.}

In this paper, we reformulate unsupervised style transfer as a paraphrase generation problem, and present a simple methodology based on fine-tuning pretrained language models on automatically generated paraphrase data. Despite its simplicity, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art style transfer systems on both human and automatic evaluations. We also survey 23 style transfer papers and discover that existing automatic metrics can be easily gamed and propose fixed variants.

  abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 39.7{\textbackslash}\% and 18.9{\textbackslash}\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art results. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and two globally connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of convolutional nets. To reduce overfitting in the globally connected layers we employed a new regularization method that proved to be very effective.}

Evaluators may have questions about test recordings, but have no way of asking them. Interactive conversational assistants provide a Q\&amp;A dynamic that may improve analysis efficiency and evaluator autonomy. To understand the full range of analysis-related questions, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz design probe study with 20 participants who interacted with simulated AI assistants via text or voice. We found that participants asked for five categories of information: user actions, user mental model, help from the AI assistant, product and task information, and user demographics. Those who used the text assistant asked more questions, but the question lengths were similar. The text assistant was perceived as significantly more efficient, but both were rated equally in satisfaction and trust. We also provide design considerations for future conversational AI assistants for UX evaluation.},

We compare ChatGPT with a multilingual XLM-RoBERTa language model that was fine-tuned on datasets, manually annotated with genres. The models are compared on test sets in two languages: English and Slovenian. Results show that ChatGPT outperforms the fine-tuned model when applied to the dataset which was not seen before by either of the models. Even when applied on Slovenian language as an under-resourced language, ChatGPT's performance is no worse than when applied to English. However, if the model is fully prompted in Slovenian, the performance drops significantly, showing the current limitations of ChatGPT usage on smaller languages. The presented results lead us to questioning whether this is the beginning of an end of laborious manual annotation campaigns even for smaller languages, such as Slovenian.},

In light of the challenge, we develop AutoWebGLM, a GPT-4-outperforming automated web navigation agent built upon ChatGLM3-6B. Inspired by human browsing patterns, we design an HTML simplification algorithm to represent webpages, preserving vital information succinctly. We employ a hybrid human-AI method to build web browsing data for curriculum training. Then, we bootstrap the model by reinforcement learning and rejection sampling to further facilitate webpage comprehension, browser operations, and efficient task decomposition by itself. For testing, we establish a bilingual benchmark -- AutoWebBench -- for real-world web browsing tasks. We evaluate AutoWebGLM across diverse web navigation benchmarks, revealing its improvements but also underlying challenges to tackle real environments.

We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study. Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such as the model size and task are carefully chosen.},

LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.}

Current models include inclined decay with an exponential adjustment, SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) compartmental model, discrete time stochastic processes, and transmission tree. While many of these models incorporate contact tracing to predict spread pattern, key elements on optimal usage of scarce resources and effective and efficient process performance (e.g., diagnostics and screening, non-pharmaceutical interventions, trained personnel/robots for treatment, decontamination) have not been included. This is particularly critical in the fight of COVID-19 containment due to lack of testing kits and the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, and the long period of hospitalization required by severely sick patients.This work focuses on designing a system computational decision modeling framework that simultaneously i) captures disease spread characteristics, ii) incorporates day-to-day hospital and home care processes and resource usage, iii) explores non-pharmaceutical intervention, social and human behavior and iv) allows for system optimization to minimize infection and mortality under time and labor constraints.},

However, these existing methods face several challenges including the heterogeneity of patients' underlying health conditions and the difficulty modeling complex interactions between sleep stages. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture named DREAM to tackle these issues for automatic sleep staging. DREAM consists of (i) a feature representation network that generates robust representations for sleep signals via the variational auto-encoder framework and contrastive learning and (ii) a sleep stage classification network that explicitly models the interactions between sleep stages in the sequential context at both feature representation and label classification levels via Transformer and conditional random field architectures. Our experimental results indicate that DREAM significantly outperforms existing methods for automatic sleep staging on three sleep signal datasets.}

Interpretable Person-Job Fit system can show reasons for giving recommendations or not recommending specific jobs to some people, and vice versa. Such reasons help us understand according to what the final decision is made by the system and guarantee a high recommending accuracy. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit have focused on 1) one perspective, without considering the variances of role and psychological motivation between interviewer and job seeker; 2) modeling the matching degree between resume and job requirements directly through a deep neural network without interaction matching modules, which leads to shortage on interpretation. To this end, we propose an Interpretable Person-Job Fit (IPJF) model, which 1) models the Person-Job Fit problem from the perspectives/intentions of employer and job seeker in a multi-tasks optimization fashion to interpretively formulate the Person-Job Fit process; 2) leverages deep interactive representation learning to automatically learn the interdependence between a resume and job requirements without relying on a clear list of job seeker's abilities, and deploys the optimizing problem as a learning to rank problem. Experiments on large real dataset show that the proposed IPJF model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and also gives promising interpretable recommending reasons.},

Such explanations enable us to generate useful additional labeled data from unlabeled instances, bolstering the pool of available training data. On three popular NLP tasks (named entity recognition, relation extraction, sentiment analysis), we find that using this enhanced supervision allows our models to surpass competitive baseline F1 scores by more than 5-10 percentage points, while using 2X times fewer labeled instances.

  abstract = {Following the impressive development of LLMs, vision-language alignment in LLMs is actively being researched to enable multimodal reasoning and visual input/output. This direction of research is particularly relevant to medical imaging because accurate medical image analysis and generation consist of a combination of reasoning based on visual features and prior knowledge. Many recent works have focused on training adapter networks that serve as an information bridge between image processing (encoding or generating) networks and LLMs; but presumably, in order to achieve maximum reasoning potential of LLMs on visual information as well, visual and language features should be allowed to interact more freely. This is especially important in the medical domain because understanding and generating medical images such as chest X-rays (CXR) require not only accurate visual and language-based reasoning but also a more intimate mapping between the two modalities. Thus, taking inspiration from previous work on the transformer and VQ-GAN combination for bidirectional image and text generation, we build upon this approach and develop a method for instruction-tuning an LLM pre-trained only on text to gain vision-language capabilities for medical images. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained LLM's existing question-answering and instruction-following abilities to teach it to understand visual inputs by instructing it to answer questions about image inputs and, symmetrically, output both text and image responses appropriate to a given query by tuning the LLM with diverse tasks that encompass image-based text-generation and text-based image-generation. We show that our LLM-CXR trained in this approach shows better image-text alignment in both CXR understanding and generation tasks while being smaller in size compared to previously developed models that perform a narrower range of tasks.},

  abstract = {In this work, we explore ``prompt tuning,'' a simple yet effective mechanism for learning ``soft prompts'' to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ``closes the gap'' and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed ``prefix tuning'' of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient ``prompt ensembling.'' We release code and model checkpoints to reproduce our experiments.}

  abstract = {We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other more recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also report ablation experiments that replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to better measure which factors most influence end-task performance.},

  abstract = {Open-domain Question Answering models which directly leverage question-answer (QA) pairs, such as closed-book QA (CBQA) models and QA-pair retrievers, show promise in terms of speed and memory compared to conventional models which retrieve and read from text corpora. QA-pair retrievers also offer interpretable answers, a high degree of control, and are trivial to update at test time with new knowledge. However, these models lack the accuracy of retrieve-and-read systems, as substantially less knowledge is covered by the available QA-pairs relative to text corpora like Wikipedia. To facilitate improved QA-pair models, we introduce Probably Asked Questions (PAQ), a very large resource of 65M automatically-generated QA-pairs. We introduce a new QA-pair retriever, RePAQ, to complement PAQ. We find that PAQ preempts and caches test questions, enabling RePAQ to match the accuracy of recent retrieve-and-read models, whilst being significantly faster. Using PAQ, we train CBQA models which outperform comparable baselines by 5\%, but trail RePAQ by over 15\%, indicating the effectiveness of explicit retrieval. RePAQ can be configured for size (under 500MB) or speed (over 1K questions per second) whilst retaining high accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate RePAQ's strength at selective QA, abstaining from answering when it is likely to be incorrect. This enables RePAQ to ``back-off" to a more expensive state-of-the-art model, leading to a combined system which is both more accurate and 2x faster than the state-of-the-art model alone.},

All patients, nurses, and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Our central goal is to enable a doctor agent to learn how to treat illness within the simulacrum. To do so, we propose a method called MedAgent-Zero. As the simulacrum can simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs, doctor agents can keep accumulating experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases. Simulation experiments show that the treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. More interestingly, the knowledge the doctor agents have acquired in Agent Hospital is applicable to real-world medicare benchmarks. After treating around ten thousand patients (real-world doctors may take over two years), the evolved doctor agent achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.06\% on a subset of the MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This work paves the way for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical scenarios.},

  abstract = {LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new POMDP called Flex-POMDP, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.},

The first is the definition of 1,000 everyday activities, grounded in 50 scenes (houses, gardens, restaurants, offices, etc.) with more than 5,000 objects annotated with rich physical and semantic properties. The second is OmniGibson, a novel simulation environment that supports these activities via realistic physics simulation and rendering of rigid bodies, deformable bodies, and liquids. Our experiments indicate that the activities in BEHAVIOR-1K are long-horizon and dependent on complex manipulation skills, both of which remain a challenge for even state-of-the-art robot learning solutions. To calibrate the simulation-to-reality gap of BEHAVIOR-1K, we provide an initial study on transferring solutions learned with a mobile manipulator in a simulated apartment to its real-world counterpart.

  abstract = {User engagement prediction plays a critical role for designing interaction strategies to grow user engagement and increase revenue in online social platforms. Through the in-depth analysis of the real-world data from the world's largest professional social platforms, i.e., LinkedIn, we find that users expose diverse engagement patterns, and a major reason for the differences in user engagement patterns is that users have different intents. That is, people have different intents when using LinkedIn, e.g., applying for jobs, building connections, or checking notifications, which shows quite different engagement patterns. Meanwhile, user intents and the corresponding engagement patterns may change over time. Although such pattern differences and dynamics are essential for user engagement prediction, differentiating user engagement patterns based on user dynamic intents for better user engagement forecasting has not received enough attention in previous works. In this paper, we proposed a Dynamic Intent Guided Meta Network (DIGMN), which can explicitly model user intent varying with time and perform differentiated user engagement forecasting. Specifically, we derive some interpretable basic user intents as prior knowledge from data mining and introduce prior intents in explicitly modeling dynamic user intent. Furthermore, based on the dynamic user intent representations, we propose a meta predictor to perform differentiated user engagement forecasting. Through a comprehensive evaluation on LinkedIn anonymous user data, our method outperforms stateof-the-art baselines significantly, i.e., 2.96\% and 3.48\% absolute error reduction, on coarse-grained and fine-grained user engagement prediction tasks, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.},

Unlike prior work that manually or automatically finds the optimal prompt for each task, we train a policy LM to generate discrete tokens as ``directional stimulus'' of each input, which is a hint/cue such as keywords of an article for summarization. The directional stimulus is then combined with the original input and fed into the LLM to guide its generation toward the desired target. The policy LM can be trained through 1) supervised learning from annotated data and 2) reinforcement learning from offline and online rewards to explore directional stimulus that better aligns LLMs with human preferences. This framework is flexibly applicable to various LMs and tasks. To verify its effectiveness, we apply our framework to summarization and dialogue response generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that it can significantly improve LLMs' performance with a small collection of training data: a T5 (780M) trained with 2,000 samples from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset improves Codex (175B)'s performance by 7.2\% in ROUGE-Avg scores; 500 dialogues boost the combined score by 52.5\%, achieving comparable or even better performance than fully trained models on the MultiWOZ dataset.},

To date, research on these privacy concerns has been model-centered: exploring how LLMs lead to privacy risks like memorization, or can be used to infer personal characteristics about people from their content. We argue that there is a need for more research focusing on the human aspect of these privacy issues: e.g., research on how design paradigms for LLMs affect users' disclosure behaviors, users' mental models and preferences for privacy controls, and the design of tools, systems, and artifacts that empower end-users to reclaim ownership over their personal data. To build usable, efficient, and privacy-friendly systems powered by these models with imperfect privacy properties, our goal is to initiate discussions to outline an agenda for conducting human-centered research on privacy issues in LLM-powered systems. This Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to bring together researchers with backgrounds in usable security and privacy, human-AI collaboration, NLP, or any other related domains to share their perspectives and experiences on this problem, to help our community establish a collective understanding of the challenges, research opportunities, research methods, and strategies to collaborate with researchers outside of HCI.},

Graph neural networks (GNNs), as an effective graph representation technique, have shown impressive performance in learning graph embedding. However, KGs have an intrinsic property of heterogeneity, which contains various types of entities and relations. How to address complex graph data and aggregate multiple types of semantic information simultaneously is a critical issue. In this article, a novel heterogeneous GNNs framework based on attention mechanism is proposed. Specifically, the neighbor features of an entity are first aggregated under each relation-path. Then the importance of different relation-paths is learned through the relation features. Finally, each relation-path-based features with the learned weight values are aggregated to generate the embedding representation. Thus, the proposed method not only aggregates entity features from different semantic aspects but also allocates appropriate weights to them. This method can capture various types of semantic information and selectively aggregate informative features. The experiment results on three real-world KGs demonstrate superior performance when compared with several state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract = {Semantic networks, such as the knowledge graph, can represent the knowledge leveraging the graph structure. Although the knowledge graph shows promising values in natural language processing, it suffers from incompleteness. This paper focuses on knowledge graph completion by predicting linkage between entities, which is a fundamental yet critical task. Semantic matching is a potential solution as it can deal with unseen entities, which the translational distance based methods struggle with. However, to achieve competitive performance as translational distance based methods, semantic matching based methods require large-scale datasets for the training purpose, which are typically unavailable in practical settings. Therefore, we employ the language model and introduce a novel knowledge graph architecture named LP-BERT, which contains two main stages: multi-task pre-training and knowledge graph fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, three tasks are taken to drive the model to learn the relationship from triples by predicting either entities or relations. While in the fine-tuning phase, inspired by contrastive learning, we design a triple-style negative sampling in a batch, which greatly increases the proportion of negative sampling while keeping the training time almost unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a new data augmentation method utilizing the inverse relationship of triples to improve the performance and robustness of the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets, WN18RR, FB15k-237, and UMLS. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets. Significantly, Hits@10 indicator is improved by 5\% from previous state-of-the-art result on the WN18RR dataset while reaching 100\% on the UMLS dataset.},

Several studies have proposed various methods utilising pre-trained large language models for the generation of QA pairs. However, it is worth noting that these methods have primarily been evaluated on datasets that are not specifically educational in nature. Furthermore, the evaluation metrics and strategies employed in these studies differ significantly from those typically used in educational contexts. The present discourse fails to present a compelling case regarding the efficacy and practicality of stated methods within the context of higher education. This study aimed to examine multiple QA pairs generation approaches in relation to their performance and the efficacy and constraints within the context of higher education. The various approaches encompassed in this study comprise pipeline, joint, multi-task approach. The performance of these approaches under consideration was assessed on three datasets related to distinct courses. The evaluation integrates three automated methods, teacher assessments, and real-world educational evaluations to provide a comprehensive analysis. The comparison of various approaches was conducted by directly assessing their performance using the average scores of different automatic metrics on three datasets. The results of the teachers and real educational evaluation indicate that the assessments generated were beneficial in enhancing the understanding of concepts and overall performance of students. The implications of the findings from this study hold significant importance in enhancing the efficacy of QA pair generation tools within the context of higher education.},

Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.},

Most existing methods only consider direct relations in representation learning. We argue that multiple-step relation paths also contain rich inference patterns between entities, and propose a path-based representation learning model. This model considers relation paths as translations between entities for representation learning, and addresses two key challenges: (1) Since not all relation paths are reliable, we design a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure the reliability of relation paths. (2) We represent relation paths via semantic composition of relation embeddings. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, as compared with baselines, our model achieves significant and consistent improvements on knowledge base completion and relation extraction from text.

Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.},

  abstract = {The alignment tuning process of large language models (LLMs) typically involves instruction learning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). A recent study, LIMA (Zhou et al. 2023), shows that using merely 1K examples for SFT can achieve significant alignment performance as well, suggesting that the effect of alignment tuning might be "superficial." This raises questions about how exactly the alignment tuning transforms a base LLM. We analyze the effect of alignment tuning by examining the token distribution shift between base LLMs and their aligned counterpart. Our findings reveal that base LLMs and their alignment-tuned versions perform nearly identically in decoding on the majority of token positions. Most distribution shifts occur with stylistic tokens. These direct evidence strongly supports the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis suggested by LIMA. Based on these findings, we rethink the alignment of LLMs by posing the research question: how effectively can we align base LLMs without SFT or RLHF? To address this, we introduce a simple, tuning-free alignment method, URIAL. URIAL achieves effective alignment purely through in-context learning (ICL) with base LLMs, requiring as few as three constant stylistic examples and a system prompt. We conduct a fine-grained and interpretable evaluation on a diverse set of examples, named JUST-EVAL-INSTRUCT. Results demonstrate that base LLMs with URIAL can match or even surpass the performance of LLMs aligned with SFT or SFT+RLHF. We show that the gap between tuning-free and tuning-based alignment methods can be significantly reduced through strategic prompting and ICL. Our findings on the superficial nature of alignment tuning and results with URIAL suggest that deeper analysis and theoretical understanding of alignment is crucial to future LLM research.},

It performs communication among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' communication is leveraged to enhance human cooperation, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication towards effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes.},

  abstract = {Medical image segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis. In recent years, deep learning based approaches have shown exceptional performance when trained on a fully-annotated dataset. However, data annotation is often a significant bottleneck, especially for 3D medical images. Active learning (AL) is a promising solution for efficient annotation but requires an initial set of labeled samples to start active selection. When the entire data pool is unlabeled, how do we select the samples to annotate as our initial set? This is also known as the cold-start AL, which permits only one chance to request annotations from experts without access to previously annotated data. Coldstart AL is highly relevant in many practical scenarios but has been under-explored, especially for 3D medical segmentation tasks requiring substantial annotation effort. In this paper, we present a benchmark named COLosSAL by evaluating six cold-start AL strategies on five 3D medical image segmentation tasks from the public Medical Segmentation Decathlon collection. We perform a thorough performance analysis and explore important open questions for cold-start AL, such as the impact of budget on different strategies. Our results show that cold-start AL is still an unsolved problem for 3D segmentation tasks but some important trends have been observed. The code repository, data partitions, and baseline results for the complete benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/MedICL-VU/COLosSAL.},

  abstract = {The quality of texts generated by natural language generation (NLG) systems is hard to measure automatically. Conventional reference-based metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, have been shown to have relatively low correlation with human judgments, especially for tasks that require creativity and diversity. Recent studies suggest using large language models (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, which have the benefit of being applicable to new tasks that lack human references. However, these LLM-based evaluators still have lower human correspondence than medium-size neural evaluators. In this work, we present G-Eval, a framework of using large language models with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and a form-filling paradigm, to assess the quality of NLG outputs. We experiment with two generation tasks, text summarization and dialogue generation. We show that G-Eval with GPT-4 as the backbone model achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.514 with human on summarization task, outperforming all previous methods by a large margin. We also propose preliminary analysis on the behavior of LLM-based evaluators, and highlight the potential issue of LLM-based evaluators having a bias towards the LLM-generated texts.

  abstract = {Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have powered Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, showing promise in automating tasks on computing devices. Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks. Resources at https://github.com/Reallm-Labs/InfiGUI-R1.},

However, existing encoder-decoder summarization models have difficulty learning the latent alignment between source documents and summaries because of their vast disparity in length. In this paper, we propose a extractor-abstractor framework in which the keyword-based extractor selects a few sets of salient sentences from the input document and then the abstractor paraphrases these sets of sentences in parallel, which are more aligned to the summary, to generate the final summary. The new extractor and abstractor are pretrained from a set of ``pseudo summaries'' extracted by specially designed heuristics, and then further trained together in a reinforcement learning framework. The results show that the proposed model generates high-quality summaries with faster training speed and less training memory footprint, and outperforms the state-of-the-art models on CNN/Daily Mail, Webis-TLDR-17, Webis-Snippet-20, WikiHow and DUC-2002 datasets.},

This task is challenging due to the complex mapping relationships between job descriptions and skills, which is caused by complex influencing factors. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Graph Neural Network based Skill Prediction model (MGNSP) to make skill prediction by learning effective deep semantics matching of job positions and skills. Specifically, to capture the complex heterogeneous relations among the job positions, skills, and meta information, we devise a joint learning approach of graph neural networks for multiple information networks, which are J-Net, S-Net and JS-Net, respectively. After jointly learning complementary semantics of job positions and skills with three multi-layer graph neural networks from these information networks, the skills are predicted by learning to match their representations. Extensive experimental results on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of our model.}

LLM-powered agents typically require invoking LLM APIs and employing artificially designed complex prompts, which results in high inference latency. While this paradigm works well in scenarios with minimal interactive demands, such as code generation, it is unsuitable for highly interactive and real-time applications, such as gaming. Traditional gaming AI often employs small models or reactive policies, enabling fast inference but offering limited task completion and interaction abilities. In this work, we consider Overcooked as our testbed where players could communicate with natural language and cooperate to serve orders. We propose a Hierarchical Language Agent (HLA) for human-AI coordination that provides both strong reasoning abilities while keeping real-time execution. In particular, HLA adopts a hierarchical framework and comprises three modules: a proficient LLM, referred to as Slow Mind, for intention reasoning and language interaction, a lightweight LLM, referred to as Fast Mind, for generating macro actions, and a reactive policy, referred to as Executor, for transforming macro actions into atomic actions. Human studies show that HLA outperforms other baseline agents, including slow-mind-only agents and fast-mind-only agents, with stronger cooperation abilities, faster responses, and more consistent language communications.},

  abstract = {In-context learning is a new learning paradigm where a language model conditions on a few input-output pairs (demonstrations) and a test input, and directly outputs the prediction. It has been shown sensitive to the provided demonstrations and thus promotes the research of demonstration retrieval: given a test input, relevant examples are retrieved from the training set to serve as informative demonstrations for in-context learning. While previous works train task-specific retrievers for several tasks separately, these methods are hard to transfer and scale on various tasks, and separately trained retrievers will cause a lot of parameter storage and deployment cost. In this paper, we propose Unified Demonstration Retriever (UDR), a single model to retrieve demonstrations for a wide range of tasks. To train UDR, we cast various tasks' training signals into a unified list-wise ranking formulation by language model's feedback. Then we propose a multi-task list-wise ranking training framework with an iterative mining strategy to find high-quality candidates, which can help UDR fully incorporate various tasks' signals. Experiments on 30+ tasks across 13 task families and multiple data domains show that UDR significantly outperforms baselines. Further analyses show the effectiveness of each proposed component and UDR's strong ability in various scenarios including different LMs (1.3B 175B), unseen datasets, varying demonstration quantities, etc. We will release the code and model checkpoint after review.}

Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y{\textbar}x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) agents improve through trial-and-error, but when reward is sparse and the agent cannot discover successful action sequences, learning stagnates. This has been a notable problem in training deep RL agents to perform web-based tasks, such as booking flights or replying to emails, where a single mistake can ruin the entire sequence of actions. A common remedy is to ``warmstart'' the agent by pre-training it to mimic expert demonstrations, but this is prone to overfitting. Instead, we propose to constrain exploration using demonstrations. From each demonstration, we induce high-level ``workflows'' which constrain the allowable actions at each time step to be similar to those in the demonstration (e.g., ``Step 1: click on a textbox; Step 2: enter some text''). Our exploration policy then learns to identify successful workflows and samples actions that satisfy these workflows. Workflows prune out bad exploration directions and accelerate the agent's ability to discover rewards. We use our approach to train a novel neural policy designed to handle the semi-structured nature of websites, and evaluate on a suite of web tasks, including the recent World of Bits benchmark. We achieve new state-of-the-art results, and show that workflow-guided exploration improves sample efficiency over behavioral cloning by more than 100x.},

  abstract = {The "Patient Instruction" (PI), which contains critical instructional information provided both to carers and to the patient at the time of discharge, is essential for the patient to manage their condition outside hospital. An accurate and easy-to-follow PI can improve the self-management of patients which can in turn reduce hospital readmission rates. However, writing an appropriate PI can be extremely time consuming for physicians, and is subject to being incomplete or error-prone for (potentially overworked) physicians. Therefore, we propose a new task that can provide an objective means of avoiding incompleteness, while reducing clinical workload: the automatic generation of the PI, which is imagined as being a document that the clinician can review, modify, and approve as necessary (rather than taking the human "out of the loop"). We build a benchmark clinical dataset and propose the Re\${\textasciicircum}3\$Writer, which imitates the working patterns of physicians to first retrieve related working experience from historical PIs written by physicians, then reason related medical knowledge. Finally, it refines the retrieved working experience and reasoned medical knowledge to extract useful information, which is used to generate the PI for previously-unseen patient according to their health records during hospitalization. Our experiments show that, using our method, the performance of 6 different models can be substantially boosted across all metrics, with up to 20\%, 11\%, and 19\% relative improvements in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, respectively. Meanwhile, we show results from human evaluations to measure the effectiveness in terms of its usefulness for clinical practice.

  abstract = {Large language models(LLMs) have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. Hosting these models at scale requires significant memory resources. One crucial memory bottleneck for the deployment stems from the context window. It is commonly recognized that model weights are memory hungry; however, the size of key-value embedding stored during the generation process (KV cache) can easily surpass the model size. The enormous size of the KV cache puts constraints on the inference batch size, which is crucial for high throughput inference workload. Inspired by an interesting observation of the attention scores, we hypothesize the persistence of importance: only pivotal tokens, which had a substantial influence at one step, will significantly influence future generations. Based on our empirical verification and theoretical analysis around this hypothesis, we propose Scissorhands, a system that maintains the memory usage of the KV cache at a fixed budget without finetuning the model. In essence, Scissorhands manages the KV cache by storing the pivotal tokens with a higher probability. We validate that Scissorhands reduces the inference memory usage of the KV cache by up to 5X without compromising model quality. We further demonstrate that Scissorhands can be combined with 4-bit quantization, traditionally used to compress model weights, to achieve up to 20X compression.},

These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents.

  abstract = {GPT-3 has attracted lots of attention due to its superior performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, especially with its in-context learning abilities. Despite its success, we found that the empirical results of GPT-3 depend heavily on the choice of in-context examples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective strategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random sampling) that better leverage GPT-3's in-context learning capabilities. Inspired by the recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment neural networks, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar to a test query sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative inputs to unleash GPT-3's power of text generation. We evaluate the proposed approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks, where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms the random selection baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders fine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results. Notably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-to-text generation (44.3\% on the ToTTo dataset) and open-domain question answering (45.5\% on the NQ dataset).}

Further, we create a use case taxonomy from real user scenarios and construct an instruction tuning dataset accordingly.

This design choice ensures the model's ability to capture critical semantic and detailed information across various visual tasks.

We analyse this phenomenon in detail, establishing that: it is present across model sizes (even for the largest current models), it is not related to a specific subset of samples, and that a given good permutation for one model is not transferable to another. While one could use a development set to determine which permutations are performant, this would deviate from the true few-shot setting as it requires additional annotated data. Instead, we use the generative nature of language models to construct an artificial development set and based on entropy statistics of the candidate permutations on this set, we identify performant prompts. Our method yields a 13\% relative improvement for GPT-family models across eleven different established text classification tasks.}

In this work, we conduct an empirical experiment on four datasets from three different domains comparing SOTA LLMs with small models trained on expert annotations with AL. We found that small models can outperform GPT-3.5 with a few hundreds of labeled data, and they achieve higher or similar performance with GPT-4 despite that they are hundreds time smaller. Based on these findings, we posit that LLM predictions can be used as a warmup method in real-world applications and human experts remain indispensable in tasks involving data annotation driven by domain-specific knowledge.},

  abstract = {The automation of code review activities, a long-standing pursuit in software engineering, has been primarily addressed by numerous domain-specific pre-trained models. Despite their success, these models frequently demand extensive resources for pre-training from scratch. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an intriguing alternative, given their remarkable capabilities when supplemented with domain-specific knowledge. However, their potential for automating code review tasks remains largely unexplored. In response to this research gap, we present LLaMA-Reviewer, an innovative framework that leverages the capabilities of LLaMA, a popular LLM, in the realm of code review. Mindful of resource constraints, this framework employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, delivering high performance while using less than 1\% of trainable parameters. An extensive evaluation of LLaMA-Reviewer is conducted on two diverse, publicly available datasets. Notably, even with the smallest LLaMA base model consisting of 6.7B parameters and a limited number of tuning epochs, LLaMA-Reviewer equals the performance of existing code-review-focused models. The ablation experiments provide insights into the influence of various fine-tuning process components, including input representation, instruction tuning, and different PEFT methods. To foster continuous progress in this field, the code and all PEFT-weight plugins have been made open-source.},

  abstract = {Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating and improving LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in the web action generation task, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from online shopping human actions. We present the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web action generation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasoning traces into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in behavior simulation and offers actionable insights into how real-world action data and reasoning augmentation can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.},

  abstract = {Commonsense knowledge used by humans while doing online shopping is valuable but difficult to be captured by existing systems running on e-commerce platforms. While construction of common- sense knowledge graphs in e-commerce is non-trivial, representation learning upon such graphs poses unique challenge compared to well-studied open-domain knowledge graphs (e.g., Freebase). By leveraging the commonsense knowledge and representation techniques, various applications in e-commerce can be benefited. Based on AliCoCo, the large-scale e-commerce concept net assisting a series of core businesses in Alibaba, we further enrich it with more commonsense relations and present AliCoCo2, the first commonsense knowledge graph constructed for e-commerce use. We propose a multi-task encoder-decoder framework to provide effective representations for nodes and edges from AliCoCo2. To explore the possibility of improving e-commerce businesses with commonsense knowledge, we apply newly mined commonsense relations and learned embeddings to e-commerce search engine and recommendation system in different ways. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed representation learning method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of knowledge graph completion (KGC), and applications on search and recommendation indicate great potential value of the construction and use of commonsense knowledge graph in e-commerce. Besides, we propose an e-commerce QA task with a new benchmark during the construction of AliCoCo2, for testing machine common sense in e-commerce, which can benefit research community in exploring commonsense reasoning.},

The semantic gap in-between prevents shopping experience from being more intelligent. In this paper, we propose to construct a large-scale E-commerce Cognitive Concept Net named "AliCoCo", which is practiced in Alibaba, the largest Chinese e-commerce platform in the world. We formally define user needs in e-commerce, then conceptualize them as nodes in the net.

Moreover, existing fine-tuning and in-context learning techniques fail to generalize across multiple websites. We introduce Wilbur, an approach that uses a differentiable ranking model and a novel instruction synthesis technique to optimally populate a black-box large language model's prompt with task demonstrations from previous runs. To maximize end-to-end success rates, we also propose an intelligent backtracking mechanism that learns and recovers from its mistakes. Finally, we show that our ranking model can be trained on data from a generative auto-curriculum which samples representative goals from an LLM, runs the agent, and automatically evaluates it, with no manual annotation. Wilbur achieves state-of-the-art results on the WebVoyager benchmark, beating text-only models by 8\% overall, and up to 36\% on certain websites. On the same benchmark, Wilbur is within 5\% of a strong multi-modal model despite only receiving textual inputs, and further analysis reveals a substantial number of failures are due to engineering challenges of operating the web.},

To support this problem, we introduce WEBLINX - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expert demonstrations of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broad range of patterns on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train and evaluate agents in diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of information present, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages in real-time. To solve this bottleneck, we design a retrieval-inspired model that efficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking relevant elements. We use the selected elements, along with screenshots and action history, to assess a variety of models for their ability to replicate human behavior when navigating the web. Our experiments span from small text-only to proprietary multimodal LLMs. We find that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were explicitly pretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to generalize to unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal models that can generalize to novel settings.

While achieving decent performance, previous methods implicitly assume a forward-only execution mode for the model, where they only provide oracle trajectories as in-context examples to guide the model on how to reason in the environment. Consequently, the model could not handle more challenging scenarios not covered in the in-context examples, e.g., mistakes, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose to model the interactive task as state space exploration, where the LLM agent transitions among a pre-defined set of states by performing actions to complete the task. This formulation enables flexible backtracking, allowing the model to recover from errors easily. We evaluate our proposed LLM Agent with State-Space ExploRation (LASER) on both the WebShop task and amazon.com. Experimental results show that LASER significantly outperforms previous methods and closes the gap with human performance on the web navigation task.},

Such issues are critical in our domain, where, in many cases, researchers attempt to identify and study theoretically interesting categories that can be rare in a target corpus. Specifically, imbalanced distributions, with a skewed distribution of texts among the categories, can lead to a lengthy and expensive annotation stage, forcing practitioners to sample and label large numbers of texts to train a classification model. In this paper, we provide an overview of the issue, and describe existing strategies for mitigating such challenges. Noting the pitfalls of previous solutions, we then provide a semi-supervised method -- Expert Initiated Latent Space Sampling -- that complements researcher domain expertise with a systematic, unsupervised exploration of the latent semantic space to overcome such limitations. Utilizing simulations to systematically evaluate our method and compare it to existing approaches, we show that our procedure offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and accuracy in many classification tasks.}

Objective: The aim of this study was to describe application of the most important rules to help decision makers to be good or excellent decision makers in medical practice at every level of health care system. Methods: The author used descriptive method of explanation teoretical and practical issues regarding application of od decision making processes in the praxis, based on searchied scientific literature about this topic deposited in online databases. Results and Discussion: The author of this paper discussed about important topics: a) the importance of medical decision in emergency situations; b) the varies of decision making with solving problems by medical professionals; c) the limitations when it comes to medical decison making; and d) what doctors need to follow regarding decision making in the praxis. Two factors that have influenced to the decision process: a) degree of uncertainty about future events; b) usefulness of outcomes in any particular case. The clinical decision problem analysis process demands: a) explicit formalization of a decision making problem or the description of the medical problem decision with a registration of all possible actions which have to be undertaken and registration of all the possible so determined outcomes. b) construction of the decision tree which presents all described actions and outcomes with predictions of the probabilities and the choice of the most optimal action based on the probability outcome and its use. Doing this allows us to delve deeper into more intricate options present within medical decision making. Simple put, a decision is a choice between two options. The person or entity conducting that decision is the decision maker. The exact definition is ``Under the decision should imply some specific action which is selected from several variables or which satisfies the expectation that is previously set''.Many different factors and individuals may be involved in medical decision making, with varying consequences, according to different players and settings. Conclusion: A vital component of medical decision making is evaluation. Decision makers must concisely evaluate situations, in order to make better choices. For example, when examining a health care system, their decisions should consider the following questions, such as, what is the health status of the given population? What economic resources are at the disposal of our patients, and government? How effective is the current healthcare model that is already in place? Does the existing social system pay enough attention to the healthcare protection? Does the organisation structure of the healthcare system satisfy? Are the existing practice and the healthcare technologies secure, effective, and suitable? Are the planning, programming, determination and the choice of priority the adequate to the needs of people? How are the monitoring and evaluation of healthcare system quality organised? These are a few examples of evaluation in medical decision making.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of neural-network architectures have been proposed for the task of Chinese word segmentation. Surprisingly, we find that a bidirectional LSTM model, when combined with standard deep learning techniques and best practices, can achieve better accuracy on many of the popular datasets as compared to models based on more complex neuralnetwork architectures. Furthermore, our error analysis shows that out-of-vocabulary words remain challenging for neural-network models, and many of the remaining errors are unlikely to be fixed through architecture changes. Instead, more effort should be made on exploring resources for further improvement.}

  abstract = {Most of the current models that are used to simulate users in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) lack realism and agency. Such models generally make decisions in a stochastic manner, without recourse to the actual information encountered or the underlying information need. In this paper, we develop a more sophisticated model of the user that includes their cognitive state within the simulation. The cognitive state maintains data about what the simulated user knows, has done and has seen, along with representations of what it considers attractive and relevant. Decisions to inspect or judge are then made based upon the simulated user's current state, rather than stochastically. In the context of ad-hoc topic retrieval, we evaluate the quality of the simulated users and agents by comparing their behaviour and performance against 48 human subjects under the same conditions, topics, time constraints, costs and search engine. Our findings show that while naive configurations of simulated users and agents substantially outperform our human subjects, their search behaviour is notably different from actual searchers. However, more sophisticated search agents can be tuned to act more like actual searchers providing greater realism. This innovation advances the state of the art in simulation, from simulated users towards autonomous agents. It provides a much needed step forward enabling the creation of more realistic simulations, while also motivating the development of more advanced cognitive agents and tools to help support and augment human searchers. Future work will focus not only on the pragmatics of tuning and training such agents for topic retrieval, but will also look at developing agents for other tasks and contexts such as collaborative search and slow search.},

However, in this study, we discovered that many layers of LLMs exhibit high similarity, and some layers play a negligible role in network functionality. Based on this observation, we define a metric called Block Influence (BI) to gauge the significance of each layer in LLMs. We then propose a straightforward pruning approach: layer removal, in which we directly delete the redundant layers in LLMs based on their BI scores. Experiments demonstrate that our method, which we call ShortGPT, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in model pruning. Moreover, ShortGPT is orthogonal to quantization-like methods, enabling further reduction in parameters and computation. The ability to achieve better results through simple layer removal, as opposed to more complex pruning techniques, suggests a high degree of redundancy in the model architecture.},

The framework is based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm, where keywords and templates are encoded first, and the decoder judiciously attends over the contexts derived from the encoded keywords and templates to generate the sentences. Training exploits weak supervision, as the model trains on a large amount of labeled data with keywords and POS based templates prepared through completely automatic means. Qualitative and quantitative performance analyses on publicly available test-data in various domains reveal our system's superiority over baselines, built using state-of-the-art neural machine translation and controllable transfer techniques.

While some efforts have leveraged behavioral theories from social science, validated theories specifically applicable to  Agent-based modeling remain limited. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework to model the situated, adaptive nature of human cognition and choice. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework, Psychologically-Valid Generative Agents. These agents consist of a Cognitive Architecture that provides data-driven and cognitively-constrained decision-making functionality, and a Large Language Model that generates human-like linguistic data. In addition, our framework benefits from Stance Detection, a Natural Language Processing technique, that allows highly personalize initialization of the agents, based on real-world data, within Agent-based modeling simulations. This combination provides a flexible yet structured approach to endogenously represent how people perceive, deliberate, and respond to social or other types of complex decision-making dynamics. Previous work has demonstrated promising results by using a subset of the components of our proposed architecture. Our approach has the potential to exhibit highly-realistic human behavior and can be used across a variety of domains (e.g., public health, group dynamics, social and psychological sciences, and financial markets).}

We follow a similar transduction method, in which we transpose the more difficult direct source to target TST task to a simpler Style-Masked Language Model (SMLM) Task, wherein, similar to BERT {\textbackslash}cite\{bert\}, the goal of our model is now to reconstruct the source sentence from its style-masked version. We arrive at the SMLM mechanism naturally by formulating prototype editing/ transduction methods in a probabilistic framework, where TST resolves into estimating a hypothetical parallel dataset from a partially observed parallel dataset, wherein each domain is assumed to have a common latent style-masked prior. To generate this style-masked prior, we use "Explainable Attention" as our choice of attribution for a more precise style-masking step and also introduce a cost-effective and accurate "Attribution-Surplus" method of determining the position of masks from any arbitrary attribution model in O(1) time. We empirically show that this non-generational approach well suites the "content preserving" criteria for a task like TST, even for a complex style like Discourse Manipulation. Our model, the Style MLM, outperforms strong TST baselines and is on par with state-of-the-art TST models, which use complex architectures and orders of more parameters.},

  abstract = {Large language models have led to state-of-the-art accuracies across a range of tasks. However, training these models efficiently is challenging for two reasons: a) GPU memory capacity is limited, making it impossible to fit large models on even a multi-GPU server, and b) the number of compute operations required to train these models can result in unrealistically long training times. Consequently, new methods of model parallelism such as tensor and pipeline parallelism have been proposed. Unfortunately, naive usage of these methods leads to fundamental scaling issues at thousands of GPUs, e.g., due to expensive cross-node communication or devices spending significant time waiting on other devices to make progress. In this paper, we show how different types of parallelism methods (tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism) can be composed to scale to thousands of GPUs and models with trillions of parameters. We survey techniques for pipeline parallelism and propose a novel interleaved pipeline parallelism schedule that can improve throughput by 10+\% with memory footprint comparable to existing approaches. We quantitatively study the trade-offs between tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism, and provide intuition as to how to configure distributed training of a large model. Our approach allows us to perform training iterations on a model with 1 trillion parameters at 502 petaFLOP/s on 3072 GPUs with achieved per-GPU throughput of 52\% of theoretical peak.

We argue that these two tasks - making the software work for themselves and also for their wider scientific community - could not be differentiated from each other at the beginning of the software development process. Rather, this division of labor and software capacities emerged, articulated by the actors themselves as they went about their tasks. The activities of making the novel software "work" at all, and the "extra work" of making that software repurposable or reusable could not be distinguished until near the end of the development process - rather than defined or structured in advance. We discuss implications for the trajectory of software development, and the practical work of making software repurposable.},

On the other hand, query-based summarization highlights those points that are relevant in the context of a given query. The encode-attend-decode paradigm has achieved notable success in machine translation, extractive summarization, dialog systems, etc. But it suffers from the drawback of generation of repeated phrases. In this work we propose a model for the query-based summarization task based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm with two key additions (i) a query attention model (in addition to document attention model) which learns to focus on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary. In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based summarization dataset building on debatepedia. Our experiments show that with these two additions the proposed model clearly outperforms vanilla encode-attend-decode models with a gain of 28\% (absolute) in ROUGE-L scores.},

We present a general interactive framework that enables an agent to request and interpret rich, contextually useful information from an assistant that has knowledge about the task and the environment. We demonstrate the practicality of our framework on a simulated human-assisted navigation problem. Aided with an assistance-requesting policy learned by our method, a navigation agent achieves up to a 7\{{\textbackslash}texttimes\} improvement in success rate on tasks that take place in previously unseen environments, compared to fully autonomous behavior. We show that the agent can take advantage of different types of information depending on the context, and analyze the benefits and challenges of learning the assistance-requesting policy when the assistant can recursively decompose tasks into subtasks.},

An agent solving tasks in a HANNA environment can leverage simulated human assistants, called ANNA (Automatic Natural Navigation Assistants), which, upon request, provide natural language and visual instructions to direct the agent towards the goals. To address the HANNA problem, we develop a memory-augmented neural agent that hierarchically models multiple levels of decision-making, and an imitation learning algorithm that teaches the agent to avoid repeating past mistakes while simultaneously predicting its own chances of making future progress. Empirically, our approach is able to ask for help more effectively than competitive baselines and, thus, attains higher task success rate on both previously seen and previously unseen environments.}

Integrating this multimodal data can improve disease diagnoses using deep learning models. However, effectively combining different modalities for diagnosis remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as attention mechanisms and contrastive learning, have attempted to address this but do not fully integrate the modalities into a unified feature space. This paper presents EHR-KnowGen, a multimodal learning model enhanced with external domain knowledge, for improved disease diagnosis generation from diverse patient information in EHRs. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates different modalities into a unified feature space with soft prompts learning and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate disease diagnoses. By incorporating external domain knowledge from different levels of granularity, we enhance the extraction and fusion of multimodal information, resulting in more accurate diagnosis generation. Experimental results on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate the superiority of our generative model over comparative methods, providing explainable evidence to enhance the understanding of diagnosis results.}

Specifically, GPT-4 is used to simulate the user and agent interaction, generating thousands of dialogues annotated with DST labels. Then a two-stage fine-tuning on LLaMA 2 is performed on the generated data and the real data for the DST prediction. Experimental results on two public DST benchmarks show that with the generated dialogue data, our model performs better than the baseline trained solely on real data. In addition, our approach is also capable of adapting to the dynamic demands in real-world scenarios, generating dialogues in new domains swiftly. After replacing dialogue segments in any domain with the corresponding generated ones, the model achieves comparable performance to the model trained on real data.},

  abstract = {Generalist foundation models such as GPT-4 have displayed surprising capabilities in a wide variety of domains and tasks. Yet, there is a prevalent assumption that they cannot match specialist capabilities of fine-tuned models. For example, most explorations to date on medical competency benchmarks have leveraged domain-specific training, as exemplified by efforts on BioGPT and Med-PaLM. We build on a prior study of GPT-4's capabilities on medical challenge benchmarks in the absence of special training. Rather than using simple prompting to highlight the model's out-of-the-box capabilities, we perform a systematic exploration of prompt engineering. We find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks. The prompting methods we explore are general purpose, and make no specific use of domain expertise, removing the need for expert-curated content. Our experimental design carefully controls for overfitting during the prompt engineering process. We introduce Medprompt, based on a composition of several prompting strategies. With Medprompt, GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine of the benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. The method outperforms leading specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by a significant margin with an order of magnitude fewer calls to the model. Steering GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves a 27\% reduction in error rate on the MedQA dataset over the best methods to date achieved with specialist models and surpasses a score of 90\% for the first time. Beyond medical problems, we show the power of Medprompt to generalize to other domains and provide evidence for the broad applicability of the approach via studies of the strategy on exams in electrical engineering, machine learning, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology.},

Our review of ten years of literature included 171 articles published in the proceedings of the Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (AAAI HCOMP) and the ACM Digital Library. We found that pilot studies in crowdsourcing research (i.e., crowd pilot studies) are often under-reported in the literature. Important details, such as the number of workers and rewards to workers, are often not reported. On the basis of our findings, we reflect on the current state of practice and formulate a set of best practice guidelines for reporting crowd pilot studies in crowdsourcing research.

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

This paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to autonomously select between fast and slow inference methods, thereby optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness. We introduce a dynamic decision-making framework that categorizes tasks into two distinct pathways: 'Fast', designated for tasks where the LLM quickly identifies a high-confidence solution, and 'Slow', allocated for tasks that the LLM perceives as complex and for which it has low confidence in immediate solutions as well as requiring more reasoning paths to verify.

Building on WebCanvas, we open-source an agent framework with extensible modules for reasoning, providing a foundation for the community to conduct online inference and evaluations. Our best-performing agent achieves a task success rate of 23.1\% and a task completion rate of 48.8\% on the Mind2Web-Live test set. Additionally, we analyze the performance discrepancies across various websites, domains, and experimental environments. We encourage the community to contribute further insights on online agent evaluation, thereby advancing this field of research.},

  abstract = {The task of Reading Comprehension with Multiple Choice Questions, requires a human (or machine) to read a given \{passage, question\} pair and select one of the n given options. The current state of the art model for this task first computes a questionaware representation for the passage and then selects the option which has the maximum similarity with this representation. However, when humans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a combination of elimination and selection. Specifically, a human would first try to eliminate the most irrelevant option and then read the passage again in the light of this new information (and perhaps ignore portions corresponding to the eliminated option). This process could be repeated multiple times till the reader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose ElimiNet, a neural network-based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it has gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the \{passage, question\} pair and if so it tries to make the passage representation orthogonal to this eliminated option (akin to ignoring portions of the passage corresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of partial elimination to refine the passage representation and finally uses a selection module to pick the best option. We evaluate our model on the recently released large scale RACE dataset and show that it outperforms the current state of the art model on 7 out of the 13 question types in this dataset. Further, we show that taking an ensemble of our elimination-selection based method with a selection based method gives us an improvement of 3.1\% over the best-reported performance on this dataset.},

In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture---observation, planning, and reflection---each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliably generating highly structured outputs, such as program code, mathematical formulas, or well-formed markup. Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints.},

Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain.

This prototyping practice is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input the designer's description of a community's design -- goal, rules, and member personas -- and produce as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of "what if?" scenarios where community members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the observation that large language models' training data already includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine their social computing designs when using social simulacra.},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have repeatedly shown their ability to produce fluent text. Yet even when starting from a prompt, generation can continue in many plausible directions. Current decoding methods with the goal of controlling generation, e.g., to ensure specific words are included, either require additional models or fine-tuning, or work poorly when the task at hand is semantically unconstrained, e.g., story generation. In this work, we present a plug-and-play decoding method for controlled language generation that is so simple and intuitive, it can be described in a single sentence: given a topic or keyword, we add a shift to the probability distribution over our vocabulary towards semantically similar words. We show how annealing this distribution can be used to impose hard constraints on language generation, something no other plug-and-play method is currently able to do with SOTA language generators. Despite the simplicity of this approach, we see it works incredibly well in practice: decoding from GPT-2 leads to diverse and fluent sentences while guaranteeing the appearance of given guide words. We perform two user studies, revealing that (1) our method outperforms competing methods in human evaluations; and (2) forcing the guide words to appear in the generated text has no impact on the fluency of the generated text.}

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated some capability to navigate novel environments as agents in a zero-shot or few-shot fashion, purely guided by natural language instructions as prompts. Recent research has also demonstrated LLMs have the capability to exceed their base performance through self-improvement, i.e. fine-tuning on data generated by the model itself. In this work, we explore the extent to which LLMs can self-improve their performance as agents in long-horizon tasks in a complex environment using the WebArena benchmark. In WebArena, an agent must autonomously navigate and perform actions on web pages to achieve a specified objective. We explore fine-tuning on three distinct synthetic training data mixtures and achieve a 31\% improvement in task completion rate over the base model on the WebArena benchmark through a self-improvement procedure. We additionally contribute novel evaluation metrics for assessing the performance, robustness, capabilities, and quality of trajectories of our fine-tuned agent models to a greater degree than simple, aggregate-level benchmark scores currently used to measure self-improvement.},

But as learning programming requires a significant personal commitment, we confirm the results of other studies, that cheating leads to higher failure rates and lower scores in the examination. Automatic plagiarism detection systems are therefore measures against cheating. We analyzed the students' achievements and opinions during the last 5 years of operating an automated assessment system with plagiarism detection. The paper discusses in detail the benefits of such a system, e.g. the equal treatment of all students compared to manual plagiarism checks, and shows also the disadvantages, e.g. code obfuscation, that students perform in order to circumvent the system.}

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5--7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy---and therefore they fail to implement a strongly~held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.},

We explore this impact on the syntactic capabilities of RoBERTa, using models trained on incremental sizes of raw text data. First, we use syntactic structural probes to determine whether models pretrained on more data encode a higher amount of syntactic information. Second, we perform a targeted syntactic evaluation to analyze the impact of pretraining data size on the syntactic generalization performance of the models. Third, we compare the performance of the different models on three downstream applications: part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and paraphrase identification. We complement our study with an analysis of the cost-benefit trade-off of training such models. Our experiments show that while models pretrained on more data encode more syntactic knowledge and perform better on downstream applications, they do not always offer a better performance across the different syntactic phenomena and come at a higher financial and environmental cost.},

  abstract = {Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across most benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises concerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden computations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought tokens.},

Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.},

  abstract = {Large scale adoption of large language models has introduced a new era of convenient knowledge transfer for a slew of natural language processing tasks. However, these models also run the risk of undermining user trust by exposing unwanted information about the data subjects, which may be extracted by a malicious party, e.g. through adversarial attacks. We present an empirical investigation into the extent of the personal information encoded into pre-trained representations by a range of popular models, and we show a positive correlation between the complexity of a model, the amount of data used in pre-training, and data leakage. In this paper, we present the first wide coverage evaluation and comparison of some of the most popular privacy-preserving algorithms, on a large, multi-lingual dataset on sentiment analysis annotated with demographic information (location, age and gender). The results show since larger and more complex models are more prone to leaking private information, use of privacy-preserving methods is highly desirable. We also find that highly privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy (DP) can have serious model utility effects, which can be ameliorated using hybrid or metric-DP techniques.},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been used to generate code, providing a flexible interface for synthesizing programs from natural language specifications. However, they often violate syntactic and semantic rules of their output language, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose SYNCHROMESH: a framework for substantially improving the reliability of pre-trained models for code generation. SYNCHROMESH comprises two components. First, it retrieves few-shot examples from a training bank using Target Similarity Tuning (TST), a novel method for semantic example selection. TST learns to recognize utterances that describe similar target programs despite differences in surface natural language features. Then, SYNCHROMESH feeds the examples to a pre-trained language model and samples programs using Constrained Semantic Decoding (CSD): a general framework for constraining the output to a set of valid programs in the target language. CSD leverages constraints on partial outputs to sample complete correct programs, and needs neither re-training nor fine-tuning of the language model. We evaluate our methods by synthesizing code from natural language descriptions using GPT-3 and Codex in three real-world languages: SQL queries, Vega-Lite visualizations and SMCalFlow programs. These domains showcase rich constraints that CSD is able to enforce, including syntax, scope, typing rules, and contextual logic. We observe substantial complementary gains from CSD and TST in prediction accuracy and in effectively preventing run-time errors.},

These goals range from flooding conversations with a certain narrative, to increasing the public's engagement with news sources of questionable quality, to stoking tensions between ideologically opposed groups to weaken public trust. The prevailing theoretical framework for understanding SSIOs is to treat them as a social botnet: a behaviorally homogeneous cluster of coordinated activity. However, the social bot framework is both at odds with some of the behaviors observed in early SSIOs and more broadly with the wide swathe of goals these operations set out to accomplish. To examine the fit of the social bot framework in the SSIO context, we develop a novel bag-of-words based method for clustering and describing user activity traces. Applying this method to a comprehensive repository of SSIOs conducted on Twitter over the last decade, we find that SSIOs violate both the core assumption of the social bot framework, and how it is operationalized in practical work. Instead, we find that SSIOs exhibit a clear division of labor and propose cooperative work with social roles as a more effective theoretical framework for understanding SSIOs. Through applying this framework, we find that the roles that SSIO agents take on have become more stable and simple over time, which holds substantial implications for developing methods for detection of these operations in the wild.},

  abstract = {Software development is a complex task that necessitates cooperation among multiple members with diverse skills. Numerous studies used deep learning to improve specific phases in a waterfall model, such as design, coding, and testing. However, the deep learning model in each phase requires unique designs, leading to technical inconsistencies across various phases, which results in a fragmented and ineffective development process. In this paper, we introduce ChatDev, a chat-powered software development framework in which specialized agents driven by large language models (LLMs) are guided in what to communicate (via chat chain) and how to communicate (via communicative dehallucination). These agents actively contribute to the design, coding, and testing phases through unified language-based communication, with solutions derived from their multi-turn dialogues. We found their utilization of natural language is advantageous for system design, and communicating in programming language proves helpful in debugging. This paradigm demonstrates how linguistic communication facilitates multi-agent collaboration, establishing language as a unifying bridge for autonomous task-solving among LLM agents.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Intention-in-Interaction (IN3), a novel benchmark designed to inspect users' implicit intentions through explicit queries. Next, we propose the incorporation of model experts as the upstream in agent designs to enhance user-agent interaction. Employing IN3, we empirically train Mistral-Interact, a powerful model that proactively assesses task vagueness, inquires user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals before starting downstream agent task execution. Integrating it into the XAgent framework, we comprehensively evaluate the enhanced agent system regarding user instruction understanding and execution, revealing that our approach notably excels at identifying vague user tasks, recovering and summarizing critical missing information, setting precise and necessary agent execution goals, and minimizing redundant tool usage, thus boosting overall efficiency.

  abstract = {Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools, allowing them to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the advent of foundation models, AI systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm, i.e., tool learning with foundation models, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving. Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors in this field. To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in this paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate a general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the generalization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool learning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 18 representative tools and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing tools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation for tool learning. Overall, we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.},

Recent research of the session-based recommender system mainly focuses on sequential patterns by utilizing the attention mechanism, which is straightforward for the session's natural sequence sorted by time. However, the user's preference is much more complicated than a solely consecutive time pattern in the transition of item choices. In this paper, therefore, we study the item transition pattern by constructing a session graph and propose a novel model which collaboratively considers the sequence order and the latent order in the session graph for a session-based recommender system. We formulate the next item recommendation within the session as a graph classification problem. Specifically, we propose a weighted attention graph layer and a Readout function to learn embeddings of items and sessions for the next item recommendation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmark E-commerce datasets, Yoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

In this work, we study extractive question answering within closed domains and introduce the concept of targeted pre-training. This involves determining and generating relevant data to further pre-train our models, as opposed to the conventional philosophy of utilizing domain-specific FMs trained on a wide range of data. Our proposed framework uses Galactica to generate synthetic, ``targeted'' corpora that align with specific writing styles and topics, such as research papers and radiology reports.

We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText.

The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

To that end, we create semantically meaningful tuple of codewords to serve as a Semantic ID for each item. Given Semantic IDs for items in a user session, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model is trained to predict the Semantic ID of the next item that the user will interact with. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Semantic ID-based generative model for recommendation tasks. We show that recommender systems trained with the proposed paradigm significantly outperform the current SOTA models on various datasets. In addition, we show that incorporating Semantic IDs into the sequence-to-sequence model enhances its ability to generalize, as evidenced by the improved retrieval performance observed for items with no prior interaction history.},

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (\$19.1\$-\$40.3{\textbackslash}\%\$), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks.

  abstract = {Transformer-based language models spread FLOPs uniformly across input sequences. In this work we demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute) to specific positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens (\$k\$) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-\$k\$ routing mechanism. Since \$k\$ is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the \$k\$ tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50{\textbackslash}\% faster to step during post-training sampling.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision are primarily driven by the usage of deep learning, which is known to require large amounts of data, and creating datasets for this purpose is not a trivial task. Larger benchmark datasets often have detailed processes with multiple stages and users with different roles during annotation. However, this can be difficult to implement in smaller projects where resources can be limited. Therefore, in this work we present our processes for creating an image dataset for kernel fragmentation and stover overlengths in Whole Plant Corn Silage. This includes the guidelines for annotating object instances in respective classes and statistics of gathered annotations. Given the challenging image conditions, where objects are present in large amounts of occlusion and clutter, the datasets appear appropriate for training models. However, we experience annotator inconsistency, which can hamper evaluation. Based on this we argue the importance of having an evaluation form independent of the manual annotation where we evaluate our models with physically based sieving metrics. Additionally, instead of the traditional time-consuming manual annotation approach, we evaluate Semi-Supervised Learning as an alternative, showing competitive results while requiring fewer annotations. Specifically, given a relatively large supervised set of around 1400 images we can improve the Average Precision by a number of percentage points. Additionally, we show a significantly large improvement when using an extremely small set of just over 100 images, with over 3{\texttimes} in Average Precision and up to 20 percentage points when estimating the quality.},

We present Snorkel, a first-of-its-kind system that enables users to train state-of- the-art models without hand labeling any training data. Instead, users write labeling functions that express arbitrary heuristics, which can have unknown accuracies and correlations. Snorkel denoises their outputs without access to ground truth by incorporating the first end-to-end implementation of our recently proposed machine learning paradigm, data programming. We present a flexible interface layer for writing labeling functions based on our experience over the past year collaborating with companies, agencies, and research labs. In a user study, subject matter experts build models 2.8{\texttimes} faster and increase predictive performance an average 45.5\% versus seven hours of hand labeling. We study the modeling tradeoffs in this new setting and propose an optimizer for automating tradeoff decisions that gives up to 1.8{\texttimes} speedup per pipeline execution. In two collaborations, with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and on four open-source text and image data sets representative of other deployments, Snorkel provides 132\% average improvements to predictive performance over prior heuristic approaches and comes within an average 3.60\% of the predictive performance of large hand-curated training sets.},

The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.}

Specially, we propose BASES, a novel user simulation framework with LLM-based agents, designed to facilitate comprehensive simulations of web search user behaviors. Our simulation framework can generate unique user profiles at scale, which subsequently leads to diverse search behaviors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of BASES, we conduct evaluation experiments based on two human benchmarks in both Chinese and English, demonstrating that BASES can effectively simulate large-scale human-like search behaviors.

  abstract = {Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize the performance gain of the model by marking the fewest samples. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize massive parameters, so that the model learns how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we are in an era of information torrents and we have massive amounts of data. In this way, DL has aroused strong interest of researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, researchers have relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples. Therefore, early AL is difficult to reflect the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to the publicity of the large number of existing annotation datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, which is not allowed in some fields that require high expertise, especially in the fields of speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc. Therefore, AL has gradually received due attention. A natural idea is whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotations, while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. Therefore, deep active learning (DAL) has emerged. Although the related research has been quite abundant, it lacks a comprehensive survey of DAL. This article is to fill this gap, we provide a formal classification method for the existing work, and a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyzed and summarized the development of DAL from the perspective of application. Finally, we discussed the confusion and problems in DAL, and gave some possible development directions for DAL.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and especially reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to enable agents to learn and perform tasks autonomously with superhuman performance. However, we consider RL as fundamentally a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) paradigm, even when an agent eventually performs its task autonomously.~ In cases where the reward function is challenging or impossible to define, HITL approaches are considered particularly advantageous. The application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in systems such as ChatGPT demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing for user experience and integrating their feedback into the training loop. In HITL RL, human input is integrated during the agent's learning process, allowing iterative updates and fine-tuning based on human feedback, thus enhancing the agent's performance. Since the human is an essential part of this process, we argue that human-centric approaches are the key to successful RL, a fact that has not been adequately considered in the existing literature. This paper aims to inform readers about current explainability methods in HITL RL. It also shows how the application of explainable AI (xAI) and specific improvements to existing explainability approaches can enable a better human-agent interaction in HITL RL for all types of users, whether for lay people, domain experts, or machine learning specialists. Accounting for the workflow in HITL RL and based on software and machine learning methodologies, this article identifies four phases for human involvement for creating HITL RL systems: (1) Agent Development, (2) Agent Learning, (3) Agent Evaluation, and (4) Agent Deployment. We highlight human involvement, explanation requirements, new challenges, and goals for each phase. We furthermore identify low-risk, high-return opportunities for explainability research in HITL RL and present long-term research goals to advance the field. Finally, we propose a vision of human-robot collaboration that allows both parties to reach their full potential and cooperate effectively.},

Active learning techniques, particularly those rooted in uncertainty sampling, offer a cost-effective solution by pinpointing the most instructive samples for manual annotation. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 provide an alternative for automated annotation but come with concerns regarding their reliability. This study introduces a novel methodology that integrates human annotators and LLMs within an Active Learning framework. We conducted evaluations on three public datasets. IMDB for sentiment analysis, a Fake News dataset for authenticity discernment, and a Movie Genres dataset for multi-label classification.The proposed framework integrates human annotation with the output of LLMs, depending on the model uncertainty levels. This strategy achieves an optimal balance between cost efficiency and classification performance. The empirical results show a substantial decrease in the costs associated with data annotation while either maintaining or improving model accuracy.},

However, performance has been shown to strongly depend on the selected training examples (termed prompts). In this work, we propose an efficient method for retrieving prompts for in-context learning using annotated data and an LM. Given an input-output pair, we estimate the probability of the output given the input and a candidate training example as the prompt, and label training examples as positive or negative based on this probability. We then train an efficient dense retriever from this data, which is used to retrieve training examples as prompts at test time. We evaluate our approach on three sequence-to-sequence tasks where language utterances are mapped to meaning representations, and find that it substantially outperforms prior work and multiple baselines across the board.}

However, evaluating persona agent performance is incredibly challenging due to the complexity of assessing persona adherence in free-form interactions across various environments that are relevant to each persona agent. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for assessing persona agents, and PersonaScore, the first automated human-aligned metric grounded in decision theory for comprehensive large-scale evaluation of persona agents. Our evaluation of 6 open and closed-source LLMs, using a benchmark encompassing 200 personas and 10,000 questions, reveals significant opportunities for advancement in persona agent capabilities across state-of-the-art models. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet only has a 2.97\% relative improvement in PersonaScore than GPT 3.5 despite being a much more advanced model. Importantly, we find that increased model size and complexity do not necessarily imply enhanced persona agent capabilities thereby highlighting the pressing need for algorithmic and architectural invention towards faithful and performant persona agents.},

To support this investigation, we collect a new dataset consisting of both item-based and language-based preferences elicited from users along with their ratings on a variety of (biased) recommended items and (unbiased) random items. Among numerous experimental results, we find that LLMs provide competitive recommendation performance for pure language-based preferences (no item preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based CF methods, despite having no supervised training for this specific task (zero-shot) or only a few labels (few-shot). This is particularly promising as language-based preference representations are more explainable and scrutable than item-based or vector-based representations.},

  abstract = {Unit tests play a key role in ensuring the correctness of software. However, manually creating unit tests is a laborious task, motivating the need for automation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to various aspects of software development, including their suggested use for automated generation of unit tests, but while requiring additional training or few-shot learning on examples of existing tests. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation on the effectiveness of LLMs for automated unit test generation without requiring additional training or manual effort. Concretely, we consider an approach where the LLM is provided with prompts that include the signature and implementation of a function under test, along with usage examples extracted from documentation. Furthermore, if a generated test fails, our approach attempts to generate a new test that fixes the problem by re-prompting the model with the failing test and error message. We implement our approach in TestPilot, an adaptive LLM-based test generation tool for JavaScript that automatically generates unit tests for the methods in a given project's API. We evaluate TestPilot using OpenAI's gpt3.5-turbo LLM on 25 npm packages with a total of 1,684 API functions. The generated tests achieve a median statement coverage of 70.2\% and branch coverage of 52.8\%. In contrast, the state-of-the feedback-directed JavaScript test generation technique, Nessie, achieves only 51.3\% statement coverage and 25.6\% branch coverage. Furthermore, experiments with excluding parts of the information included in the prompts show that all components contribute towards the generation of effective test suites. We also find that 92.8\% of TestPilot's generated tests have {\textbackslash}leq{$\leq$} 50\% similarity with existing tests (as measured by normalized edit distance), with none of them being exact copies. Finally, we run TestPilot with two additional LLMs, OpenAI's older code-cushman-002 LLM and StarCoder, an LLM for which the training process is publicly documented. Overall, we observed similar results with the former (68.2\% median statement coverage), and somewhat worse results with the latter (54.0\% median statement coverage), suggesting that the effectiveness of the approach is influenced by the size and training set of the LLM, but does not fundamentally depend on the specific model.}

  abstract = {Diagnosing and managing a patient is a complex, sequential decision making process that requires physicians to obtain information -- such as which tests to perform -- and to act upon it. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) promise to profoundly impact clinical care. However, current evaluation schemes overrely on static medical question-answering benchmarks, falling short on interactive decision-making that is required in real-life clinical work. Here, we present AgentClinic: a multimodal benchmark to evaluate LLMs in their ability to operate as agents in simulated clinical environments. In our benchmark, the doctor agent must uncover the patient's diagnosis through dialogue and active data collection. We present two open medical agent benchmarks: a multimodal image and dialogue environment, AgentClinic-NEJM, and a dialogue-only environment, AgentClinic-MedQA. We embed cognitive and implicit biases both in patient and doctor agents to emulate realistic interactions between biased agents. We find that introducing bias leads to large reductions in diagnostic accuracy of the doctor agents, as well as reduced compliance, confidence, and follow-up consultation willingness in patient agents. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that several models that excel in benchmarks like MedQA are performing poorly in AgentClinic-MedQA. We find that the LLM used in the patient agent is an important factor for performance in the AgentClinic benchmark. We show that both having limited interactions as well as too many interaction reduces diagnostic accuracy in doctor agents. The code and data for this work is publicly available at https://AgentClinic.github.io.},

  abstract = {Active learning is the iterative construction of a classification model through targeted labeling, enabling significant labeling cost savings. As most research on active learning has been carried out before transformer-based language models (``transformers'') became popular, despite its practical importance, comparably few papers have investigated how transformers can be combined with active learning to date. This can be attributed to the fact that using state-of-the-art query strategies for transformers induces a prohibitive runtime overhead, which effectively nullifies, or even outweighs the desired cost savings. For this reason, we revisit uncertainty-based query strategies, which had been largely outperformed before, but are particularly suited in the context of fine-tuning transformers. In an extensive evaluation, we connect transformers to experiments from previous research, assessing their performance on five widely used text classification benchmarks. For active learning with transformers, several other uncertainty-based approaches outperform the well-known prediction entropy query strategy, thereby challenging its status as most popular uncertainty baseline in active learning for text classification.},

However, this approach is rather restrictive in practice since collecting a large set of labeled images is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways for choosing images to be labelled from a very large collection (i.e. active learning). Our empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs when applied in batch setting. Inspired by these limitations, we define the problem of active learning as core-set selection, i.e. choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm, we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our characterization. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in image classification experiments by a large margin.},

In this paper we introduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of granularity and uses bidirectional attention flow mechanism to obtain a query-aware context representation without early summarization.

However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68\% and 38.69\% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

Recently, deep learning techniques have been exploited to automatically generate summaries for given code snippets. To achieve a profound understanding of how far we are from solving this problem and provide suggestions to future research, in this paper, we conduct a systematic and in-depth analysis of 5 state-of-the-art neural code summarization models on 6 widely used BLEU variants, 4 pre-processing operations and their combinations, and 3 widely used datasets. The evaluation results show that some important factors have a great influence on the model evaluation, especially on the performance of models and the ranking among the models. However, these factors might be easily overlooked. Specifically, (1) the BLEU metric widely used in existing work of evaluating code summarization models has many variants. Ignoring the differences among these variants could greatly affect the validity of the claimed results. Furthermore, we conduct human evaluations and find that the metric BLEU-DC is most correlated to human perception; (2) code pre-processing choices can have a large (from -18{\textbackslash}\% to +25{\textbackslash}\%) impact on the summarization performance and should not be neglected. We also explore the aggregation of pre-processing combinations and boost the performance of models; (3) some important characteristics of datasets (corpus sizes, data splitting methods, and duplication ratios) have a significant impact on model evaluation. Based on the experimental results, we give actionable suggestions for evaluating code summarization and choosing the best method in different scenarios.

We use this benchmark to measure the distractibility of cutting-edge prompting techniques for large language models, and find that the model performance is dramatically decreased when irrelevant information is included.

Trained user researchers need to analyze datasets and produce informative summaries pertaining to the original data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) could assist in generating summaries, they are known to hallucinate and produce biased responses. In this paper, we study human--AI workflows that differently delegate subtasks in user research between human experts and LLMs. Studying persona generation as our case, we found that LLMs are not good at capturing key characteristics of user data on their own. Better results are achieved when we leverage human skill in grouping user data by their key characteristics and exploit LLMs for summarizing pre-grouped data into personas. Personas generated via this collaborative approach can be more representative and empathy-evoking than ones generated by human experts or LLMs alone. We also found that LLMs could mimic generated personas and enable interaction with personas, thereby helping user researchers empathize with them. We conclude that LLMs, by facilitating the analysis of user data, may promote widespread application of qualitative methods in user research.},

Recent works attempt to mitigate the influence of conflicting gradients by directly altering the gradients based on some criteria. However, our empirical study shows that ``gradient surgery'' cannot effectively reduce the occurrence of conflicting gradients. In this paper, we take a different approach to reduce conflicting gradients from the root. In essence, we investigate the task gradients w.r.t. each shared network layer, select the layers with high conflict scores, and turn them to task-specific layers. Our experiments show that such a simple approach can greatly reduce the occurrence of conflicting gradients in the remaining shared layers and achieve better performance, with only a slight increase in model parameters in many cases. Our approach can be easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods including gradient manipulation methods and branched architecture search methods. Given a network architecture (e.g., ResNet18), it only needs to search for the conflict layers once, and the network can be modified to be used with different methods on the same or even different datasets to gain performance improvement.

However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76\% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30\% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5\% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2\%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9\% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4\%).},

  abstract = {Randomly-hashed item ids are used ubiquitously in recommendation models. However, the learned representations from random hashing prevents generalization across similar items, causing problems of learning unseen and long-tail items, especially when item corpus is large, power-law distributed, and evolving dynamically. In this paper, we propose using content-derived features as a replacement for random ids. We show that simply replacing ID features with content-based embeddings can cause a drop in quality due to reduced memorization capability. To strike a good balance of memorization and generalization, we propose to use Semantic IDs -- a compact discrete item representation learned from frozen content embeddings using RQ-VAE that captures the hierarchy of concepts in items -- as a replacement for random item ids. Similar to content embeddings, the compactness of Semantic IDs poses a problem of easy adaption in recommendation models. We propose novel methods for adapting Semantic IDs in industry-scale ranking models, through hashing sub-pieces of of the Semantic-ID sequences. In particular, we find that the SentencePiece model that is commonly used in LLM tokenization outperforms manually crafted pieces such as N-grams. To the end, we evaluate our approaches in a real-world ranking model for YouTube recommendations. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic IDs can replace the direct use of video IDs by improving the generalization ability on new and long-tail item slices without sacrificing overall model quality.},

Moreover, the word embeddings approaches were unable to model a meaningful distinction between skill-terms and non-skill-terms, while our syntactic approach was able to perform this successfully.

  abstract = {Performing tasks on the web presents fundamental challenges to large language models (LLMs), including combinatorially large open-world tasks and variations across web interfaces. Simply specifying a large prompt to handle all possible behaviors and states is extremely complex, and results in behavior leaks between unrelated behaviors. Decomposition to distinct policies can address this challenge, but requires carefully handing off control between policies. We propose Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions (SteP), an approach to dynamically compose policies to solve a diverse set of web tasks. SteP defines a Markov Decision Process where the state is a stack of policies representing the control state, i.e., the chain of policy calls. Unlike traditional methods that are restricted to static hierarchies, SteP enables dynamic control that adapts to the complexity of the task. We evaluate SteP against multiple baselines and web environments including WebArena, MiniWoB++, and a CRM simulator. On WebArena, SteP improves (14.9\% to 35.8\%) over SOTA that use GPT-4 policies, while on MiniWob++, SteP is competitive with prior works while using significantly less data.

We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model.

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization across diverse tasks, leading individuals to increasingly use them as personal assistants and universal computing engines. Nevertheless, a notable obstacle emerges when feeding numerical/temporal data into these models, such as data sourced from wearables or electronic health records. LLMs employ tokenizers in their input that break down text into smaller units. However, tokenizers are not designed to represent numerical values and might struggle to understand repetitive patterns and context, treating consecutive values as separate tokens and disregarding their temporal relationships. Here, we discuss recent works that employ LLMs for human-centric tasks such as in mobile health sensing and present a case study showing that popular LLMs tokenize temporal data incorrectly. To address that, we highlight potential solutions such as prompt tuning with lightweight embedding layers as well as multimodal adapters, that can help bridge this "modality gap". While the capability of language models to generalize to other modalities with minimal or no finetuning is exciting, this paper underscores the fact that their outputs cannot be meaningful if they stumble over input nuances.},

However, most of these studies assume either a fixed or no instruction provided in the prompt, leading to the apparent consensus that the optimization of in-context examples is critical for better performance. We challenge this consensus for instruction-tuned LLMs by investigating the necessity of optimizing in-context examples when task-specific instructions are provided, and find that there are tasks for which various ways of optimizing in-context examples yield diminishing returns. We introduce a task-specific metric called {\textbackslash}metriclong\{\} ({\textbackslash}metric) that quantifies the learnability of tasks from a given instruction, and provides a heuristic that helps decide whether to optimize for instructions or ICE for any new task. On a wide range of tasks and a systematically created instruction set with gradually added details, we validate our hypothesis empirically by computing {\textbackslash}metric with query-dependent bins of examples, comparing different instructions with ICE selection methods, and performing label perturbation experiments. We conclude that tasks can be divided into two broad classes based on the {\textbackslash}metric metric, where the returns on ICE optimization follow predictable trends when instructions are provided in the prompt.},

Recent work has focused on the quality of internal LLM confidence assessments, but the question remains of how well LLMs can communicate this internal model confidence to human users. This paper explores the disparity between external human confidence in an LLM's responses and the internal confidence of the model. Through experiments involving multiple-choice questions, we systematically examine human users' ability to discern the reliability of LLM outputs. Our study focuses on two key areas: (1) assessing users' perception of true LLM confidence and (2) investigating the impact of tailored explanations on this perception. The research highlights that default explanations from LLMs often lead to user overestimation of both the model's confidence and its' accuracy. By modifying the explanations to more accurately reflect the LLM's internal confidence, we observe a significant shift in user perception, aligning it more closely with the model's actual confidence levels. This adjustment in explanatory approach demonstrates potential for enhancing user trust and accuracy in assessing LLM outputs. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication of confidence levels in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the reliability of AI-generated information is essential.},

Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using coded cause of death from CVDs (heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm/dissection). Analyses were adjusted by age, race, and sex. Among 28 cancer types, 1 228 328 patients (38.0\%) died from cancer and 365 689 patients (11.3\%) died from CVDs. Among CVDs, 76.3\% of deaths were due to heart disease. In eight cancer sites, CVD mortality risk surpassed index-cancer mortality risk in at least one calendar year. Cardiovascular disease mortality risk was highest in survivors diagnosed at \&lt;35\,years of age. Further, CVD mortality risk is highest (SMR 3.93, 95\% confidence interval 3.89--3.97) within the first year after cancer diagnosis, and CVD mortality risk remains elevated throughout follow-up compared to the general population.The majority of deaths from CVD occur in patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, or bladder cancer. We observed that from the point of cancer diagnosis forward into survivorship cancer patients (all sites) are at elevated risk of dying from CVDs compared to the general US population. In endometrial cancer, the first year after diagnosis poses a very high risk of dying from CVDs, supporting early involvement of cardiologists in such patients.}

  abstract = {Session-based Recommendation aims at predicting the next interacted item based on short anonymous behavior sessions. However, existing solutions neglect to model two inherent properties of sequential representing distributions, i.e., hierarchy structures resulted from item popularity and collaborations existing in both intra- and inter-session. Tackling with these two factors at the same time is challenging. On the one hand, traditional Euclidean space utilized in previous studies fails to capture hierarchy structures due to a restricted representation ability. On the other hand, the intuitive apply of hyperbolic geometry could extract hierarchical patterns but more emphasis on degree distribution weakens intraand inter-session collaborations. To address the challenges, we propose a Hierarchy-Aware Dual Clustering Graph Network (HADCG) model for session-based recommendation. Towards the frst challenge, we design the hierarchy-aware graph modeling module which converts sessions into hyperbolic session graphs, adopting hyperbolic geometry in propagation and attention mechanism so as to integrate chronological and hierarchical information. As for the second challenge, we introduce the deep dual clustering module which develops a two-level clustering strategy, i.e., information regularizer for intra-session clustering and contrastive learner for inter-session clustering, to enhance hyperbolic representation learning from collaborative perspectives and further promote recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efectiveness of the proposed HADCG.},

  abstract = {Generative language models are usually pretrained on large text corpus via predicting the next token (i.e., sub-word/word/phrase) given the previous ones. Recent works have demonstrated the impressive performance of large generative language models on downstream tasks. However, existing generative language models generally neglect an inherent challenge in text corpus during training, i.e., the imbalance between frequent tokens and infrequent ones. It can lead a language model to be dominated by common and easy-to-learn tokens, thereby overlooking the infrequent and difficult-to-learn ones. To alleviate that, we propose an Information Entropy Loss (InfoEntropy Loss) function. During training, it can dynamically assess the learning difficulty of a to-be-learned token, according to the information entropy of the corresponding predicted probability distribution over the vocabulary. Then it scales the training loss adaptively, trying to lead the model to focus more on the difficult-to-learn tokens. On the Pile dataset, we train generative language models at different scales of 436M, 1.1B, and 6.7B parameters. Experiments reveal that models incorporating the proposed InfoEntropy Loss can gain consistent performance improvement on downstream benchmarks.},

The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with. We propose LEARN-BY-INTERACT, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. LEARN-BY-INTERACT synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld, and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of LEARN-BY-INTERACT in various downstream agentic tasks --- baseline results are improved up to 11.1\% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 23.1\% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 10.6\% improvement for training. Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We expect that LEARN-BY-INTERACT will serve as a foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments.},

The problems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models. In our benchmark, these problems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable numerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Empirical results underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini demonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset. Furthermore, the benchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical reasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

  abstract = {The goal of intent-aware session recommendation (ISR) approaches is to capture user intents within a session for accurate next-item prediction. However, the capability of these approaches is limited by assuming all sessions have a uniform and fixed number of intents. In reality, user sessions can vary, where the number of intentions may differ from one to another. Moreover, they can only learn user intents in the latent space, which further restricts the model's transparency. To ease these issues, we propose a simple yet effective paradigm for ISR motivated by the advanced reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first create an initial prompt to instruct LLMs to predict the next item by inferring varying user intents reflected in a session. Then, we propose an effective optimization mechanism to automatically optimize prompts with an iterative self-reflection. Finally, we leverage the robust generalizability of LLMs across diverse domains to efficiently select the optimal prompt for ISR. As such, the proposed paradigm effectively guides LLMs to identify varying user intents at a semantic level, thus delivering more accurate and comprehensible recommendations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets verify the superiority of our proposed method.},

We illustrate our approach's novelty and effectiveness with three case studies: First, GNNViz can assist non expert users to easily explore the relationship between graph topology and GNN's decision (Preserve), or to manipulate the prediction (Promote or Attack) for an image classification task on MS-COCO; Second, on the Pokec social network dataset, our framework can uncover unfairness and demographic biases; Lastly, it compares with state-of-the-art GNN explainer baseline on a synthetic dataset.},

  abstract = {Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface: {\textbackslash}url\{https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\_doc/roformer\}.},

  abstract = {Although supervised machine learning is popular for information extraction from clinical notes, creating large annotated datasets requires extensive domain expertise and is time-consuming. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising transfer learning capability. In this study, we explored whether recent LLMs can reduce the need for large-scale data annotations. We curated a manually-labeled dataset of 769 breast cancer pathology reports, labeled with 13 categories, to compare zero-shot classification capability of the GPT-4 model and the GPT-3.5 model with supervised classification performance of three model architectures: random forests classifier, long short-term memory networks with attention (LSTM-Att), and the UCSF-BERT model. Across all 13 tasks, the GPT-4 model performed either significantly better than or as well as the best supervised model, the LSTM-Att model (average macro F1 score of 0.83 vs. 0.75). On tasks with high imbalance between labels, the differences were more prominent. Frequent sources of GPT-4 errors included inferences from multiple samples and complex task design. On complex tasks where large annotated datasets cannot be easily collected, LLMs can reduce the burden of large-scale data labeling. However, if the use of LLMs is prohibitive, the use of simpler supervised models with large annotated datasets can provide comparable results. LLMs demonstrated the potential to speed up the execution of clinical NLP studies by reducing the need for curating large annotated datasets. This may result in an increase in the utilization of NLP-based variables and outcomes in observational clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Large datasets have become commonplace in NLP research. However, the increased emphasis on data quantity has made it challenging to assess the quality of data. We introduce Data Maps---a model-based tool to characterize and diagnose datasets. We leverage a largely ignored source of information: the behavior of the model on individual instances during training (training dynamics) for building data maps. This yields two intuitive measures for each example---the model's confidence in the true class, and the variability of this confidence across epochs---obtained in a single run of training. Experiments across four datasets show that these model-dependent measures reveal three distinct regions in the data map, each with pronounced characteristics. First, our data maps show the presence of "ambiguous" regions with respect to the model, which contribute the most towards out-of-distribution generalization. Second, the most populous regions in the data are "easy to learn" for the model, and play an important role in model optimization. Finally, data maps uncover a region with instances that the model finds "hard to learn"; these often correspond to labeling errors. Our results indicate that a shift in focus from quantity to quality of data could lead to robust models and improved out-of-distribution generalization.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) to improve code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11\% on average, and up to 79\% for the Java -{$>$} Rust pair with greedy decoding. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation.},

Unfortunately, manual testing can be tedious, often has an overwhelming scope, and can be difficult to schedule amongst other development milestones. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for a variety of tasks including automation of UIs. However, to our knowledge, no one has yet explored the use of LLMs in controlling assistive technologies for the purposes of supporting accessibility testing. In this paper, we explore the requirements of a natural language based accessibility testing workflow, starting with a formative study. From this we build a system that takes a manual accessibility test instruction in natural language (e.g., ``Search for a show in VoiceOver'') as input and uses an LLM combined with pixel-based UI Understanding models to execute the test and produce a chaptered, navigable video. In each video, to help QA testers, we apply heuristics to detect and flag accessibility issues (e.g., Text size not increasing with Large Text enabled, VoiceOver navigation loops). We evaluate this system through a 10-participant user study with accessibility QA professionals who indicated that the tool would be very useful in their current work and performed tests similarly to how they would manually test the features. The study also reveals insights for future work on using LLMs for accessibility testing.},

These dynamic, interactive, multiagent environments pose interesting challenges for research on specialized agent capabilities as well as on the integration of these capabilities in the development of "complete" pilot agents.

The general inductive approach provides an easily used and systematic set of procedures for analyzing qualitative data that can produce reliable and valid findings.

Several studies from the Standish Group have shown that usability testing increases the chance of developing usable software. Companies are faced with many challenges: their customers demand usable products at reasonable costs and the customer base is distributed and diverse. Unfortunately, usability testing is often perceived as impractical due to the remote and distributed location of users, limited access to representative users, or a work context that is difficult to reproduce in a laboratory setting. Additionally, for some companies, the cost of transporting users or developers to remote locations can be prohibitive. Interest in remote usability testing has grown in response to these concerns.As the user advocate, the Information Technology student needs to be provided not only with hands-on experience in usability testing, but also with its nuances. These include an understanding of the wide range of formats and options available such as remote usability testing. Moreover, a remote format may be a solution for universities that do not have the resources to set up formal laboratories. There is a need to understand how best to facilitate remote testing in a classroom environment.The focus of our study was to identify appropriate tools and define methodologies for efficient and effective remote testing environments. We investigated commercial tools to determine their usefulness and cost-effectiveness for the classroom and then conducted an empirical study to compare traditional and remote usability testing of a web site using one of these tools. This paper will report on advantages and disadvantages of various remote testing tools, modifications to procedures and protocols of traditional testing, and the project findings, including usability problem identification, which establish the effectiveness of remote usability testing. Recommendations will be made for providing a credible environment for remote testing.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is an important task for understanding biomedical texts, which can be challenging due to the lack of large-scale labeled training data and domain knowledge. To address the challenge, in addition to using powerful encoders (e.g., biLSTM and BioBERT), one possible method is to leverage extra knowledge that is easy to obtain. Previous studies have shown that auto-processed syntactic information can be a useful resource to improve model performance, but their approaches are limited to directly concatenating the embeddings of syntactic information to the input word embeddings. Therefore, such syntactic information is leveraged in an inflexible way, where inaccurate one may hurt model performance. Results:{\enspace} In this paper, we propose BioKMNER, a BioNER model for biomedical texts with key-value memory networks (KVMN) to incorporate auto-processed syntactic information. We evaluate BioKMNER on six English biomedical datasets, where our method with KVMN outperforms the strong baseline method, namely, BioBERT, from the previous study on all datasets. Specifically, the F1 scores of our best performing model are 85.29\% on BC2GM, 77.83\% on JNLPBA, 94.22\% on BC5CDR-chemical, 90.08\% on NCBI-disease, 89.24\% on LINNAEUS, and 76.33\% on Species-800, where state-of-theart performance is obtained on four of them (i.e., BC2GM, BC5CDR-chemical, NCBIdisease, and Species-800). Conclusion:{\enspace} The experimental results on six English benchmark datasets demonstrate that auto-processed syntactic information can be a useful resource for BioNER and our method with KVMN can appropriately leverage such information to improve model performance.},

Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that {\textbackslash}method is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models.

  abstract = {To enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) by introducing a domain-specific instruction dataset and examining its impact when combined with multi-task learning principles. We created the BioInstruct, comprising 25,005 instructions to instruction-tune LLMs(LLaMA 1 \& 2, 7B \& 13B version). The instructions were created by prompting the GPT-4 language model with three-seed samples randomly drawn from an 80 human curated instructions. We employed Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then evaluated these instruction-tuned LLMs on several BioNLP tasks, which can be grouped into three major categories: question answering(QA), information extraction(IE), and text generation(GEN). We also examined whether categories(e.g., QA, IE, and generation) of instructions impact model performance. Comparing with LLMs without instruction-tuned, our instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrated marked performance gains: 17.3\% in QA, 5.7\% in IE, and 96\% in Generation tasks. Our 7B-parameter instruction-tuned LLaMA 1 model was competitive or even surpassed other LLMs in the biomedical domain that were also fine-tuned from LLaMA 1 with vast domain-specific data or a variety of tasks. Our results also show that the performance gain is significantly higher when instruction fine-tuning is conducted with closely related tasks. Our findings align with the observations of multi-task learning, suggesting the synergies between two tasks. The BioInstruct dataset serves as a valuable resource and instruction tuned LLMs lead to the best performing BioNLP applications.},

RecSys tasks revolve around subjectivity and personalized preferences, an under-explored domain in utilizing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our study explores several aspects to better understand reasoning for RecSys and demonstrate how task quality improves by utilizing LLM reasoning in both zero-shot and finetuning settings.

  abstract = {Medical applications of machine learning (ML) have experienced a surge in popularity in recent years. The intensive care unit (ICU) is a natural habitat for ML given the abundance of available data from electronic health records. Models have been proposed to address numerous ICU prediction tasks like the early detection of complications. While authors frequently report state-of-the-art performance, it is challenging to verify claims of superiority. Datasets and code are not always published, and cohort definitions, preprocessing pipelines, and training setups are difficult to reproduce. This work introduces Yet Another ICU Benchmark (YAIB), a modular framework that allows researchers to define reproducible and comparable clinical ML experiments; we offer an end-to-end solution from cohort definition to model evaluation. The framework natively supports most open-access ICU datasets (MIMIC III/IV, eICU, HiRID, AUMCdb) and is easily adaptable to future ICU datasets. Combined with a transparent preprocessing pipeline and extensible training code for multiple ML and deep learning models, YAIB enables unified model development. Our benchmark comes with five predefined established prediction tasks (mortality, acute kidney injury, sepsis, kidney function, and length of stay) developed in collaboration with clinicians. Adding further tasks is straightforward by design. Using YAIB, we demonstrate that the choice of dataset, cohort definition, and preprocessing have a major impact on the prediction performance - often more so than model class - indicating an urgent need for YAIB as a holistic benchmarking tool. We provide our work to the clinical ML community to accelerate method development and enable real-world clinical implementations. Software Repository: https://github.com/rvandewater/YAIB.},

As a result there is a pressing need to characterize their strengths and weaknesses and understand their inner workings. This article presents a case study on the task of judicial decision prediction, on a small dataset from French Courts of Appeal. Specifically, our dataset of around 1000 decisions is about the habitual place of residency of children from divorced parents. The task consists in predicting, from the facts and reasons of the documents, whether the court rules that children should live with their mother or their father. Instead of feeding the whole document to a classifier, we carefully construct the dataset to make sure that the input to the classifier does not contain any `spoilers' (it is often the case in court rulings that information all along the document mentions the final decision). Our results are mostly negative: even classifiers based on French pretrained language models (Flaubert, JuriBERT) do not classify the decisions with a reasonable accuracy. However, they can extract the decision when it is part of the input. With regards to these results, we argue that there is a strong caveat when constructing legal NLP datasets automatically.}

  abstract = {Pretrained contextualized embeddings are powerful word representations for structured prediction tasks. Recent work found that better word representations can be obtained by concatenating different types of embeddings. However, the selection of embeddings to form the best concatenated representation usually varies depending on the task and the collection of candidate embeddings, and the ever-increasing number of embedding types makes it a more difficult problem. In this paper, we propose Automated Concatenation of Embeddings (ACE) to automate the process of finding better concatenations of embeddings for structured prediction tasks, based on a formulation inspired by recent progress on neural architecture search. Specifically, a controller alternately samples a concatenation of embeddings, according to its current belief of the effectiveness of individual embedding types in consideration for a task, and updates the belief based on a reward. We follow strategies in reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of the controller and compute the reward based on the accuracy of a task model, which is fed with the sampled concatenation as input and trained on a task dataset. Empirical results on 6 tasks and 21 datasets show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance with fine-tuned embeddings in all the evaluations.}

To facilitate progress in this goal, we introduce Natural-Instructions v2, a benchmark of 1,600+ diverse language tasks and their expert-written instructions. It covers 70+ distinct task types, such as tagging, in-filling, and rewriting. These tasks are collected with contributions of NLP practitioners in the community and through an iterative peer review process to ensure their quality. With this large and diverse collection of tasks, we are able to rigorously benchmark cross-task generalization of models -- training on a subset of tasks and evaluating on the remaining unseen ones. For instance, we quantify generalization as a function of various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of instances, and model sizes. Based on these insights, we introduce Tk-Instruct, an encoder-decoder Transformer that is trained to follow a variety of in-context instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples) which outperforms existing larger models on our benchmark. We hope this benchmark facilitates future progress toward more general-purpose language understanding models.},

  abstract = {Imbalanced data distribution is a practical and common challenge in building production-level machine learning (ML) models in industry, where data usually exhibits long-tail distributions. For instance, in virtual AI Assistants, such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri, the ``play music'' or ``set timer'' utterance is exposed to an order of magnitude more traffic than other skills. This can easily cause trained models to overfit to the majority classes, categories or intents, lead to model miscalibration. The uncalibrated models output unreliable (mostly overconfident) predictions, which are at high risk of affecting downstream decision-making systems. In this work, we study the calibration of production models in the industry use-case of predicting product return reason codes in customer service conversations of an online retail store; The returns reasons also exhibit class imbalance.To alleviate the resulting miscalibration in the production ML model, we streamline the model development and deployment using focal loss (CITATION).We empirically show the effectiveness of model training with focal loss in learning better calibrated models, as compared to standard cross-entropy loss. Better calibration, in turn, enables better control of the precision-recall trade-off for the models deployed in production.}

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) open up new horizons for sequential recommendations, owing to their remarkable language comprehension and generation capabilities. However, there are still numerous challenges that should be addressed to successfully implement sequential recommendations empowered by LLMs. Firstly, user behavior patterns are often complex, and relying solely on one-step reasoning from LLMs may lead to incorrect or task-irrelevant responses. Secondly, the prohibitively resource requirements of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT-175B) are overwhelmingly high and impractical for real sequential recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel Step-by-step knowLedge dIstillation fraMework for recommendation (SLIM), paving a promising path for sequential recommenders to enjoy the exceptional reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a "slim" (i.e., resource-efficient) manner. We introduce CoT prompting based on user behavior sequences for the larger teacher model. The rationales generated by the teacher model are then utilized as labels to distill the downstream smaller student model (e.g., LLaMA2-7B). In this way, the student model acquires the step-by-step reasoning capabilities in recommendation tasks. We encode the generated rationales from the student model into a dense vector, which empowers recommendation in both ID-based and ID-agnostic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SLIM over state-of-the-art baselines, and further analysis showcasing its ability to generate meaningful recommendation reasoning at affordable costs.},

  abstract = {Source code summaries are short natural language descriptions of code snippets that help developers better understand and maintain source code. There has been a surge of work on automatic code summarization to reduce the burden of writing summaries manually. However, most contemporary approaches mainly leverage the information within the boundary of the method being summarized (i.e., local context), and ignore the broader context that could assist with code summarization. This paper explores two global contexts, namely intra-class and inter-class contexts, and proposes the model CoCoSUM: Contextual Code Summarization with Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks. CoCoSUM first incorporates class names as the intra-class context to generate the class semantic embeddings. Then, relevant Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams are extracted as inter-class context and are encoded into the class relational embeddings using a novel Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network (MRGNN). Class semantic embeddings and class relational embeddings, together with the outputs from code token encoder and AST encoder, are passed to a decoder armed with a two-level attention mechanism to generate high-quality, context-aware code summaries. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach and compare it with other automatic code summarization models. The experimental results show that CoCoSUM is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our source code and experimental data are available in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, is gaining increasing attention. Previous methods allow a single static embedding for each entity or relation, ignoring their intrinsic contextual nature, i.e., entities and relations may appear in different graph contexts, and accordingly, exhibit different properties. This work presents Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CoKE), a novel paradigm that takes into account such contextual nature, and learns dynamic, flexible, and fully contextualized entity and relation embeddings. Two types of graph contexts are studied: edges and paths, both formulated as sequences of entities and relations. CoKE takes a sequence as input and uses a Transformer encoder to obtain contextualized representations. These representations are hence naturally adaptive to the input, capturing contextual meanings of entities and relations therein. Evaluation on a wide variety of public benchmarks verifies the superiority of CoKE in link prediction and path query answering. It performs consistently better than, or at least equally well as current state-of-the-art in almost every case, in particular offering an absolute improvement of 21.0\% in H@10 on path query answering.

  abstract = {Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims at recommending items given the behavior sequences of anonymous users in a short-term session. Many recent SBR methods construct all sessions as a global graph that captures cross-session item transition patterns (i.e., users' global preference) to alleviate the problem of session data sparsity. However, these methods neglect that users' interests will drift as the time between the sessions constantly increases, limiting the performance improvement of SBR. To fill this gap, we divide all sessions into a group of time-slices and model the cross-session item transitions for every time-slice. We further construct two augmentation views (i.e., temporal graph and temporal hypergraph views) to model pairwise and high-order item transitions on SBR. In addition, we construct contrastive learning between two views to improve the recommendation performance by maximizing the mutual information between the item representations learned from the two views. Experiments on three public real-world datasets (i.e., Diginetica, Retailrocket, and Yoochoose) show that our model is consistently superior to the other state-of-the-art baselines, especially in time-sensitive datasets. For instance, our model achieves 14.42\% and 11.72\% improvements in terms of P@10 and P@20 on the Diginetica dataset, respectively.},

However, to perform diverse UI tasks with natural language, developers typically need to create separate datasets and models for each specific task, which is expensive and effort-consuming. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been shown capable of generalizing to various downstream tasks when prompted with a handful of examples from the target task. This paper investigates the feasibility of enabling versatile conversational interactions with mobile UIs using a single LLM. We designed prompting techniques to adapt an LLM to mobile UIs. We experimented with four important modeling tasks that address various scenarios in conversational interaction. Our method achieved competitive performance on these challenging tasks without requiring dedicated datasets and training, offering a lightweight and generalizable approach to enable language-based mobile interaction.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct personalized reasoning graphs. These graphs link a user's profile and behavioral sequences through causal and logical inferences, representing the user's interests in an interpretable way. Our approach, LLM reasoning graphs (LLMRG), has four components: chained graph reasoning, divergent extension, self-verification and scoring, and knowledge base self-improvement. The resulting reasoning graph is encoded using graph neural networks, which serves as additional input to improve conventional recommender systems, without requiring extra user or item information. Our approach demonstrates how LLMs can enable more logical and interpretable recommender systems through personalized reasoning graphs. LLMRG allows recommendations to benefit from both engineered recommendation systems and LLM-derived reasoning graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMRG on benchmarks and real-world scenarios in enhancing base recommendation models.},

We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.},

  abstract = {Tabular data prediction has been employed in medical applications such as patient health risk prediction. However, existing methods usually revolve around the algorithm design while overlooking the significance of data engineering. Medical tabular datasets frequently exhibit significant heterogeneity across different sources, with limited sample sizes per source. As such, previous predictors are often trained on manually curated small datasets that struggle to generalize across different tabular datasets during inference. This paper proposes to scale medical tabular data predictors (MediTab) to various tabular inputs with varying features. The method uses a data engine that leverages large language models (LLMs) to consolidate tabular samples to overcome the barrier across tables with distinct schema. It also aligns out-domain data with the target task using a "learn, annotate, and refinement" pipeline. The expanded training data then enables the pre-trained MediTab to infer for arbitrary tabular input in the domain without fine-tuning, resulting in significant improvements over supervised baselines: it reaches an average ranking of 1.57 and 1.00 on 7 patient outcome prediction datasets and 3 trial outcome prediction datasets, respectively. In addition, MediTab exhibits impressive zero-shot performances: it outperforms supervised XGBoost models by 8.9\% and 17.2\% on average in two prediction tasks, respectively.

  abstract = {Pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and its variants) have achieved remarkable success in varieties of NLP tasks. However, these models usually consist of hundreds of millions of parameters which brings challenges for fine-tuning and online serving in real-life applications due to latency and capacity constraints. In this work, we present a simple and effective approach to compress large Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based pre-trained models, termed as deep self-attention distillation. The small model (student) is trained by deeply mimicking the self-attention module, which plays a vital role in Transformer networks, of the large model (teacher). Specifically, we propose distilling the self-attention module of the last Transformer layer of the teacher, which is effective and flexible for the student. Furthermore, we introduce the scaled dot-product between values in the self-attention module as the new deep self-attention knowledge, in addition to the attention distributions (i.e., the scaled dot-product of queries and keys) that have been used in existing works. Moreover, we show that introducing a teacher assistant (Mirzadeh et al., 2019) also helps the distillation of large pre-trained Transformer models. Experimental results demonstrate that our monolingual model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different parameter size of student models. In particular, it retains more than 99\% accuracy on SQuAD 2.0 and several GLUE benchmark tasks using 50\% of the Transformer parameters and computations of the teacher model. We also obtain competitive results in applying deep self-attention distillation to multilingual pre-trained models.}

With recent advances and success, methods based on machine learning and deep learning have become increasingly popular in medical informatics. Combining data from multiple modalities may help in predictive tasks. To assess the expectations of multimodal data, we introduce a comprehensive fusion framework designed to integrate temporal variables, medical images, and clinical notes in Electronic Health Record (EHR) for enhanced performance in down-stream predictive tasks. Early, joint, and late fusion strategies were employed to effectively combine data from various modalities. Model performance and contribution scores show that multimodal models outperform uni-modal models in various tasks. Additionally, temporal signs contain more information than CXR images and clinical notes in three explored predictive tasks. Therefore, models integrating different data modalities can work better in predictive tasks.},

We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on four stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and gradient stabilization. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts.

Thus, we designed an LLM-powered autonomous recommender agent, RecMind, which is capable of leveraging external knowledge, utilizing tools with careful planning to provide zero-shot personalized recommendations. We propose a Self-Inspiring algorithm to improve the planning ability. At each intermediate step, the LLM ``self-inspires'' to consider all previously explored states to plan for the next step. This mechanism greatly improves the model`s ability to comprehend and utilize historical information in planning for recommendation. We evaluate RecMind`s performance in various recommendation scenarios. Our experiment shows that RecMind outperforms existing zero/few-shot LLM-based recommendation baseline methods in various tasks and achieves comparable performance to a fully trained recommendation model P5.}

Nevertheless, they depend heavily on human-written instruction data that is limited in quantity, diversity, and creativity, therefore hindering the generality of the tuned model. We introduce Self-Instruct, a framework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained language models by bootstrapping off its own generations. Our pipeline generates instruction, input, and output samples from a language model, then prunes them before using them to finetune the original model. Applying our method to vanilla GPT3, we demonstrate a 33\% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions, on par with the performance of InstructGPT\_001, which is trained with private user data and human annotations. For further evaluation, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5\% absolute gap behind InstructGPT\_001. Self-Instruct provides an almost annotation-free method for aligning pre-trained language models with instructions, and we release our large synthetic dataset to facilitate future studies on instruction tuning.},

  abstract = {Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research focus in both academic and industry communities. Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, we first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Then, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in the fields of social science, natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.

  abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) have been playing an increasingly important role for informed consumption, services, and decision-making in the overloaded information era and digitized economy. In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs that usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users' clicks on items), and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research. Finally, we discuss new research opportunities in this exciting and vibrant area.}

In this paper, we show that CoT reasoning is possible even with invalid demonstrations - prompting with invalid reasoning steps can achieve over 80-90\% of the performance obtained using CoT under various metrics, while still generating coherent lines of reasoning during inference. Further experiments show that other aspects of the rationales, such as being relevant to the query and correctly ordering the reasoning steps, are much more important for effective CoT reasoning.

Despite their success, no research has yet explored the potential of LLMs to perform next-item recommendations in the zero-shot setting. We have identified two major challenges that must be addressed to enable LLMs to act effectively as recommenders. First, the recommendation space can be extremely large for LLMs, and LLMs do not know about the target user's past interacted items and preferences. To address this gap, we propose a prompting strategy called Zero-Shot Next-Item Recommendation (NIR) prompting that directs LLMs to make next-item recommendations. Specifically, the NIR-based strategy involves using an external module to generate candidate items based on user-filtering or item-filtering. Our strategy incorporates a 3-step prompting that guides GPT-3 to carry subtasks that capture the user's preferences, select representative previously watched movies, and recommend a ranked list of 10 movies. We evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-3 on MovieLens 100K dataset and show that it achieves strong zero-shot performance, even outperforming some strong sequential recommendation models trained on the entire training dataset. These promising results highlight the ample research opportunities to use LLMs as recommenders. The code can be found at https://github.com/AGI-Edgerunners/LLM-Next-Item-Rec.},

We evaluate this instruction-tuned model, which we call FLAN, on unseen task types. FLAN substantially improves the performance of its unmodified counterpart and surpasses zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 datasets that we evaluate. FLAN even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ, AI2-ARC, OpenbookQA, and StoryCloze. Ablation studies reveal that number of finetuning datasets, model scale, and natural language instructions are key to the success of instruction tuning.},

  abstract = {Recent development of large-scale question answering (QA) datasets triggered a substantial amount of research into end-to-end neural architectures for QA. Increasingly complex systems have been conceived without comparison to simpler neural baseline systems that would justify their complexity. In this work, we propose a simple heuristic that guides the development of neural baseline systems for the extractive QA task. We find that there are two ingredients necessary for building a high-performing neural QA system: first, the awareness of question words while processing the context and second, a composition function that goes beyond simple bag-of-words modeling, such as recurrent neural networks. Our results show that FastQA, a system that meets these two requirements, can achieve very competitive performance compared with existing models. We argue that this surprising finding puts results of previous systems and the complexity of recent QA datasets into perspective.},

  abstract = {While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1\% to 33.9\% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5\% to 44.8\%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.},

To measure progress towards that goal, we argue for the usefulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question answering. Our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. We believe many existing learning systems can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems. We also extend and improve the recently introduced Memory Networks model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks.},

The approach is model agnostic, allows one to enforce domain-specific knowledge and constraints, and enables the construction of reliable interfaces by guaranteeing the structure of the generated text.

AEE systems are expected to assist teachers in providing increased higher-level feedback and expediting the feedback process, while supporting gains in students' writing motivation and writing quality. The current study explored these claims using a quasi-experimental study. Four eighth-grade English Language Arts (ELA) classes were assigned to a combined feedback condition in which they received feedback on their writing from their teacher and from an automated essay evaluation (AEE) system called PEG Writing{\textregistered}. Four other eighth-grade ELA classes were assigned to a teacher feedback-only condition, in which they received feedback from their teacher via GoogleDocs. Results indicated that teachers gave the same median amount feedback to students in both condition, but gave proportionately more feedback on higher-level writing skills to students in the combined PEG~+~Teacher Feedback condition. Teachers also agreed that PEG assisted them in saving one-third to half the time it took to provide feedback when they were the sole source of feedback (i.e., the GoogleDocs condition). At the conclusion of the study, students in the combined feedback condition demonstrated increases in writing persistence, though there were no differences between groups with regard to final-draft writing quality.},

We build our survey upon a corpus spanning ten different fields in computer science with an eye toward identifying important common interests. Our resulting taxonomy is organized around WHAT is visualization data and its representation, WHY and HOW to apply AI to visualization data. We highlight a set of common tasks that researchers apply to the visualization data and present a detailed discussion of AI approaches developed to accomplish those tasks.

Because humans exhibit robustness and adaptability in complex scenarios, it is crucial to introduce humans into the training loop of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging human intelligence to further advance machine learning algorithms. In this study, a real-time human-guidance-based (Hug)-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is developed for policy training in an end-to-end autonomous driving case. With our newly designed mechanism for control transfer between humans and automation, humans are able to intervene and correct the agent's unreasonable actions in real time when necessary during the model training process. Based on this human-in-the-loop guidance mechanism, an improved actor-critic architecture with modified policy and value networks is developed. The fast convergence of the proposed Hug-DRL allows real-time human guidance actions to be fused into the agent's training loop, further improving the efficiency and performance of DRL. The developed method is validated by human-in-the-loop experiments with 40 subjects and compared with other state-of-the-art learning approaches. The results suggest that the proposed method can effectively enhance the training efficiency and performance of the DRL algorithm under human guidance without imposing specific requirements on participants' expertise or experience.},

It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at \$t\$ that is then used in future forward passes \$t+{\textbackslash}tau\$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present in training result in the model computing features at \$t\$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step \$t\$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time \$t+{\textbackslash}tau\$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis.},

Our contributions are threefold: (i) we systematically investigate the process of adapting a general-purpose foundation language model towards medical domain, this involves data-centric knowledge injection through the integration of 4.8M biomedical academic papers and 30K medical textbooks, as well as comprehensive fine-tuning for alignment with domain-specific instructions; (ii) we contribute a large-scale, comprehensive dataset for instruction tuning. This dataset encompasses medical question-answering (QA), rationale for reasoning, and conversational dialogues, comprising a total of 202M tokens; (iii) we conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component. While evaluating on various public medical question-answering benchmarks, our lightweight PMCLLaMA, which consists of only 13 billion parameters, exhibits superior performance, even surpassing ChatGPT.

Previous methods model a session as a sequence and estimate user representations besides item representations to make recommendations. Though achieved promising results, they are insufficient to obtain accurate user vectors in sessions and neglect complex transitions of items. To obtain accurate item embedding and take complex transitions of items into account, we propose a novel method, i.e. Session-based Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks, SR-GNN for brevity. In the proposed method, session sequences are modeled as graphstructured data. Based on the session graph, GNN can capture complex transitions of items, which are difficult to be revealed by previous conventional sequential methods. Each session is then represented as the composition of the global preference and the current interest of that session using an attention network. Extensive experiments conducted on two real datasets show that SR-GNN evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods consistently.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel threat, WIPI, that indirectly controls Web Agent to execute malicious instructions embedded in publicly accessible webpages. To launch a successful WIPI works in a black-box environment. This methodology focuses on the form and content of indirect instructions within external webpages, enhancing the efficiency and stealthiness of the attack. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we conducted extensive experiments using 7 plugin-based ChatGPT Web Agents, 8 Web GPTs, and 3 different open-source Web Agents. The results reveal that our methodology achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90\% even in pure black-box scenarios.

  abstract = {Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a ``sink'' even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup. Code and datasets are provided at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm.},

While copious solutions, such as active learning for small language models (SLMs) and prevalent in-context learning in the era of large language models (LLMs), have been proposed and alleviate the labeling burden to some extent, their performances are still subject to human intervention. It is still underexplored how to reduce the annotation cost in the LLMs era. To bridge this, we revolutionize traditional active learning and propose an innovative collaborative learning framework FreeAL to interactively distill and filter the task-specific knowledge from LLMs. During collaborative training, an LLM serves as an active annotator inculcating its coarse-grained knowledge, while a downstream SLM is incurred as a student to filter out high-quality in-context samples to feedback LLM for the subsequent label refinery. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FreeAL largely enhances the zero-shot performances for both SLM and LLM without any human supervision.}

  abstract = {Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have gained increasing popularity due to their compelling prediction performance in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. When formulating a PLM-based prediction pipeline for NLP tasks, it is also crucial for the pipeline to minimize the calibration error, especially in safety-critical applications. That is, the pipeline should reliably indicate when we can trust its predictions. In particular, there are various considerations behind the pipeline: (1) the choice and (2) the size of PLM, (3) the choice of uncertainty quantifier, (4) the choice of fine-tuning loss, and many more. Although prior work has looked into some of these considerations, they usually draw conclusions based on a limited scope of empirical studies. There still lacks a holistic analysis on how to compose a well-calibrated PLM-based prediction pipeline. To fill this void, we compare a wide range of popular options for each consideration based on three prevalent NLP classification tasks and the setting of domain shift. In response, we recommend the following: (1) use ELECTRA for PLM encoding, (2) use larger PLMs if possible, (3) use Temp Scaling as the uncertainty quantifier, and (4) use Focal Loss for fine-tuning.},

In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3\% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smaller LLMs.},

We first find that LLM agents generally exhibit trust behavior, referred to as agent trust, under the framework of Trust Games, which are widely recognized in behavioral economics. Then, we discover that GPT-4 agents manifest high behavioral alignment with humans in terms of trust behavior, indicating the feasibility of simulating human trust behavior with LLM agents. In addition, we probe the biases of agent trust and differences in agent trust towards other LLM agents and humans. We also explore the intrinsic properties of agent trust under conditions including external manipulations and advanced reasoning strategies. Our study provides new insights into the behaviors of LLM agents and the fundamental analogy between LLMs and humans beyond value alignment. We further illustrate broader implications of our discoveries for applications where trust is paramount.},

While standard agents require constant monitoring to decide when to intervene, we aim to design proactive agents that can request human intervention only when needed. To this end, we propose an algorithm that efficiently learns to detect and avoid states that are irreversible, and proactively asks for help in case the agent does enter them.

  abstract = {Session-based recommendation, which aims to predict the user's immediate next action based on anonymous sessions, is a key task in many online services (e.g., e-commerce, media streaming). Recently, Self-Attention Network (SAN) has achieved significant success in various sequence modeling tasks without using either recurrent or convolutional network. However, SAN lacks local dependencies that exist over adjacent items and limits its capacity for learning contextualized representations of items in sequences. In this paper, we propose a graph contextualized self-attention model (GC-SAN), which utilizes both graph neural network and self-attention mechanism, for sessionbased recommendation. In GC-SAN, we dynamically construct a graph structure for session sequences and capture rich local dependencies via graph neural network (GNN). Then each session learns long-range dependencies by applying the self-attention mechanism. Finally, each session is represented as a linear combination of the global preference and the current interest of that session. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that GC-SAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently.},

  abstract = {Advances in large language models (LLMs) have empowered a variety of applications. However, there is still a significant gap in research when it comes to understanding and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in the field of mental health. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs, including Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, on various mental health prediction tasks via online text data. We conduct a broad range of experiments, covering zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction fine-tuning. The results indicate a promising yet limited performance of LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs for the mental health tasks. More importantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning can significantly boost the performance of LLMs for all tasks simultaneously. Our best-finetuned models, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5, outperform the best prompt design of GPT-3.5 (25 and 15 times bigger) by 10.9\% on balanced accuracy and the best of GPT-4 (250 and 150 times bigger) by 4.8\%. They further perform on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific language model. We also conduct an exploratory case study on LLMs' capability on the mental health reasoning tasks, illustrating the promising capability of certain models such as GPT-4. We summarize our findings into a set of action guidelines for potential methods to enhance LLMs' capability for mental health tasks. Meanwhile, we also emphasize the important limitations before achieving deployability in real-world mental health settings, such as known racial and gender bias. We highlight the important ethical risks accompanying this line of research.},

However, the enormous size and computational demands of these models pose significant challenges for adapting them to specific downstream tasks, especially in environments with limited computational resources. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers an effective solution by reducing the number of fine-tuning parameters and memory usage while achieving comparable performance to full fine-tuning. The demands for fine-tuning PLMs, especially LLMs, have led to a surge in the development of PEFT methods, as depicted in Fig. 1. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of PEFT methods for PLMs. We summarize these PEFT methods, discuss their applications, and outline future directions. Furthermore, we conduct experiments using several representative PEFT methods to better understand their effectiveness in parameter efficiency and memory efficiency. By offering insights into the latest advancements and practical applications, this survey serves as an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by PEFT in the context of PLMs.},

In addition to the input review, the quality of generated summaries is highly related to the characteristics of users and products, e.g., their historical summaries, which could provide useful clues for the target summary generation. However, most previous works ignore the underlying interaction between the given input review and the corresponding historical summaries. Therefore, we aim to explore how to effectively incorporate the history information into the summary generation. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based reasoning framework for personalized review summarization. We design an elaborately adapted transformer network containing an encoder and a decoder, to fully infer the important and informative parts among the historical summaries in terms of the input review to generate more comprehensive summaries. In the encoder of our approach, we develop an inter- and intra-attention to involve the history information selectively to learn the personalized representation of the input review. In the decoder part, we propose to incorporate the constructed reasoning memory learning from historical summaries into the original transformer decoder, and design a memory-decoder attention module to retrieve more useful information for the final summary generation. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results show our approach could generate more reasonable summaries for recommendation, and outperform many competitive baseline methods.},

ERAS protocols aim to reduce surgical complications, improving postoperative outcomes and thereby saving resources by addressing various clinical elements through a multidisciplinary approach or based on evidence. In the field of gastric cancer, the philosophy of ERAS has gradually become accepted and, in 2014, consensus guidelines for enhanced recovery after gastrectomy were published. These guidelines consist of ``procedure-specific'' guidelines and ``general (not procedure-specific) enhanced recovery items.'' In this review, we focused on the procedure-specific guidelines and tried to update the contents of every element of the procedure-specific guidelines. The procedure-specific guidelines consist of the following eight elements: ``Preoperative nutrition,'' ``Preoperative oral pharmaconutrition,'' ``Access (of gastrectomy),'' ``Wound catheters and transversus abdominis plane block,'' ``Nasogastric/Nasojejunal decompression,'' ``Perianastomotic drains,'' ``Early postoperative diet and artificial nutrition,'' and ``Audit.'' On reviewing papers supporting these elements, it was reconfirmed that the recommendations of the guidelines are pertinent and valid. Four meta-analyses concerning the evaluation of ERAS protocols for gastric cancer were included in this review. Every study showed that the ERAS protocol reduced the cost and duration of hospital stay without increasing surgical complication rates, suggesting that ERAS is effective for gastric cancer surgery. However, it cannot be said that ERAS has achieved full penetration in Japan because most evidence is established in Western countries. Future studies must focus on developing a new ERAS protocols appropriate to Japanese conditions of gastric cancer.},

Automating web tasks (like booking hotels within a budget) is increasingly sought after. Fulfilling practical needs, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Prior research often handcrafts web agent strategies (e.g., prompting templates, multi-agent systems, search methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples, which may not generalize well across all real-world scenarios. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation/action representation and the pre-training data of the LLM it's based on. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. Our study enhances an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space to better align with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4\%) and 5.9 (+15.8\%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161\%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents.},

Recently, neural network-based models have attained superior performance in solving the in-domain CWS task. Last year, Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), a new language representation model, has been proposed as a backbone model for many natural language tasks and redefined the corresponding performance. The excellent performance of BERT motivates us to apply it to solve the CWS task. By conducting intensive experiments in the benchmark datasets from the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-off, we obtain several keen observations. BERT can slightly improve the performance even when the datasets contain the issue of labeling inconsistency. When applying sufficiently learned features, Softmax, a simpler classifier, can attain the same performance as that of a more complicated classifier, e.g., Conditional Random Field (CRF). The performance of BERT usually increases as the model size increases. The features extracted by BERT can be also applied as good candidates for other neural network models.},

Existing methods first retrieve knowledge from external resources, then reason over the selected knowledge, the input image, and question for answer prediction. However, this two-step approach could lead to mismatches that potentially limit the VQA performance. For example, the retrieved knowledge might be noisy and irrelevant to the question, and the re-embedded knowledge features during reasoning might deviate from their original meanings in the knowledge base (KB). To address this challenge, we propose PICa, a simple yet effective method that Prompts GPT3 via the use of Image Captions, for knowledge-based VQA. Inspired by GPT-3's power in knowledge retrieval and question answering, instead of using structured KBs as in previous work, we treat GPT-3 as an implicit and unstructured KB that can jointly acquire and process relevant knowledge. Specifically, we first convert the image into captions (or tags) that GPT-3 can understand, then adapt GPT-3 to solve the VQA task in a few-shot manner by just providing a few in-context VQA examples. We further boost performance by carefully investigating: (i) what text formats best describe the image content, and (ii) how in-context examples can be better selected and used. PICa unlocks the first use of GPT-3 for multimodal tasks. By using only 16 examples, PICa surpasses the supervised state of the art by an absolute +8.6 points on the OK-VQA dataset. We also benchmark PICa on VQAv2, where PICa also shows a decent few-shot performance.},

Specifically, we present LegalNLI -- a specially constructed dataset reformatted from the Chinese legal datasets for other problems. The proposed LegalNLI is a document-level NLI dataset in the legal domain whose premises and hypotheses vary from hundreds to thousands of words in length. In addition, there are few artifacts in LegalNLI that are some clues so as to possibly identify the label by looking only at the hypothesis without observing the premise. Therefore, it is more effective to solve the LCI task by adopting the NLI framework instead of direct text classification methods. Finally, we provide some experiments for evaluating some existing state-of-the-art systems of sentence-level NLI task on the LegalNLI dataset and find it is challenging.}

In this paper, we propose a dual-perspective graph representation learning approach to model directed interactions between candidates and jobs. To model the two-way selection preference from the dual-perspective of job seekers and employers, we incorporate two different nodes for each candidate (or job) and characterize both successful matching and failed matching via a unified dual-perspective interaction graph. To learn dual-perspective node representations effectively, we design an effective optimization algorithm, which involves a quadruple-based loss and a dual-perspective contrastive learning loss.

Main Outcomes and Measures The choice accuracy of GPT-4V was compared to two other large language models, GPT-4 and ChatGPT. The GPT-4V explanation was evaluated across 4 qualitative metrics: image misunderstanding, text hallucination, reasoning error, and non-medical error. Results Of the 3 exams with images, NBME, AMBOSS, and DRQCE, GPT-4V achieved accuracies of 86.2\%, 62.0\%, and 73.1\%, respectively.

But in educational applications, teachers often need to decide what questions they should ask, in order to help students to improve their narrative understanding capabilities. We design an automated question-answer generation (QAG) system for this education scenario: given a story book at the kindergarten to eighth-grade level as input, our system can automatically generate QA pairs that are capable of testing a variety of dimensions of a student's comprehension skills. Our proposed QAG model architecture is demonstrated using a new expert-annotated FairytaleQA dataset, which has 278 child-friendly storybooks with 10,580 QA pairs. Automatic and human evaluations show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art QAG baseline systems. On top of our QAG system, we also start to build an interactive story-telling application for the future real-world deployment in this educational scenario.}

Extensive experiments with three open-source LLMs (FlanT5-XL, Mistral-7B, and Mixtral-8x7B) on four NLI datasets (e-SNLI, Multi-NLI, ANLI, and Contract-NLI) and one QA dataset (CommonsenseQA) illustrate that ICS can consistently enhance LLMs' performance.

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into ``The Good'' (beneficial LLM applications), ``The Bad'' (offensive applications), and ``The Ugly'' (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs' potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity.},

We develop WebShop -- a simulated e-commerce website environment with 1.18 million real-world products and 12,087 crowd-sourced text instructions. In this environment, an agent needs to navigate multiple types of webpages and issue diverse actions to find, customize, and purchase a product given an instruction. WebShop provides several challenges including understanding compositional instructions, query (re-)formulation, dealing with noisy text in webpages, and performing strategic exploration. We collect over 1,600 human trajectories to first validate the benchmark, then train and evaluate a diverse range of agents using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and pre-trained image and language models. Our best model achieves a task success rate of 29\%, which significantly outperforms rule heuristics but is far lower than expert human performance (59\%). We also analyze agent and human trajectories and ablate various model components to provide insights for developing future agents with stronger language understanding and decision making abilities. Finally, we show our agent trained on WebShop exhibits non-trivial sim-to-real transfer when evaluated on amazon.com and ebay.com, indicating the potential value of our benchmark for developing practical web agents that can operate in the wild.},

However, existing methods such as BERT model a single document, and do not capture dependencies or knowledge that span across documents. In this work, we propose LinkBERT, an LM pretraining method that leverages links between documents, e.g., hyperlinks. Given a text corpus, we view it as a graph of documents and create LM inputs by placing linked documents in the same context. We then pretrain the LM with two joint self-supervised objectives: masked language modeling and our new proposal, document relation prediction. We show that LinkBERT outperforms BERT on various downstream tasks across two domains: the general domain (pretrained on Wikipedia with hyperlinks) and biomedical domain (pretrained on PubMed with citation links). LinkBERT is especially effective for multi-hop reasoning and few-shot QA (+5\% absolute improvement on HotpotQA and TriviaQA), and our biomedical LinkBERT sets new states of the art on various BioNLP tasks (+7\% on BioASQ and USMLE).

However, the clinical utility of potential applications of these capabilities is currently underexplored. We engaged in an iterative, multidisciplinary design process to envision clinically relevant VLM interactions, and co-designed four VLM use concepts: Draft Report Generation, Augmented Report Review, Visual Search and Querying, and Patient Imaging History Highlights. We studied these concepts with 13 radiologists and clinicians who assessed the VLM concepts as valuable, yet articulated many design considerations.

  abstract = {Sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality in the USA. Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis.},

We introduce AssistantBench, a challenging new benchmark consisting of 214 realistic tasks that can be automatically evaluated, covering different scenarios and domains. We find that AssistantBench exposes the limitations of current systems, including language models and retrieval-augmented language models, as no model reaches an accuracy of more than 25 points. While closed-book LMs perform well in terms of accuracy, they exhibit low precision and tend to hallucinate facts. State-of-the-art web agents reach a score of near zero. Additionally, we introduce SeePlanAct (SPA), a new web agent that significantly outperforms previous agents, and an ensemble of SPA and closed-book models reaches the best overall performance. Moreover, we analyze failures of current systems and highlight that open web navigation remains a major challenge.}

  abstract = {Significant progress has been made in automatic text evaluation with the introduction of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. However, current sample-wise evaluation paradigm suffers from the following issues: (1) Sensitive to prompt design; (2) Poor resistance to noise; (3) Inferior ensemble performance with static reference. Inspired by the fact that humans treat both criterion definition and inter sample comparison as references for evaluation, we propose BatchEval, a paradigm that conducts batch-wise evaluation iteratively to alleviate the above problems. We explore variants under this paradigm and confirm the optimal settings are two stage procedure with heterogeneous batch composition strategy and decimal scoring format. Comprehensive experiments across 3 LLMs on 4 text evaluation tasks demonstrate that BatchEval outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10.5\% on Pearson correlations with only 64\% API cost on average. Further analyses have been conducted to verify the robustness, generalization, and working mechanism of BatchEval.},

Yet, grounding these instructions to precise interface elements remains challenging, especially in complex, high-resolution, professional environments. Traditional supervised finetuning (SFT) methods often require large volumes of diverse data and exhibit weak generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that incorporates three core strategies: (1) seed data curation to ensure high quality training samples, (2) a dense policy gradient that provides continuous feedback based on prediction accuracy, and (3) a self evolutionary reinforcement finetuning mechanism that iteratively refines the model using attention maps. With only 3k training samples, our 7B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among similarly sized models on three grounding benchmarks. Notably, it attains 47.3{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, outperforming much larger models, such as UI-TARS-72B, by a margin of 24.2{\textbackslash}\%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of RL-based approaches in enhancing GUI agent performance, particularly in high-resolution, complex environments.},

  abstract = {Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant progress in language understanding and generation. By leveraging textual features, customized LLMs are also applied for recommendation and demonstrate improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios. Yet the majority of existing methods perform training-free recommendation that heavily relies on pretrained knowledge (e.g., movie recommendation). In addition, inference on LLMs is slow due to autoregressive generation, rendering existing methods less effective for real-time recommendation. As such, we propose a two-stage framework using large language models for ranking-based recommendation (LlamaRec). In particular, we use small-scale sequential recommenders to retrieve candidates based on the user interaction history. Then, both history and retrieved items are fed to the LLM in text via a carefully designed prompt template. Instead of generating next-item titles, we adopt a verbalizer-based approach that transforms output logits into probability distributions over the candidate items. Therefore, the proposed LlamaRec can efficiently rank items without generating long text. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare against state-of-the-art baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the performance of LlamaRec, which consistently achieves superior performance in both recommendation performance and efficiency.},

The recent advances in neural network technologies make them effective and easily extendable for various tasks, including retrieval and recommendation. This raises the possibility of jointly modeling and optimizing search ranking and recommendation algorithms, with potential benefits to both. In this paper, we present theoretical and practical reasons to motivate joint modeling of search and recommendation as a research direction. We propose a general framework that simultaneously learns a retrieval model and a recommendation model by optimizing a joint loss function. Our preliminary results on a dataset of product data indicate that the proposed joint modeling substantially outperforms the retrieval and recommendation models trained independently.

This paper investigates the efficacy of these "LLM evaluators", particularly in using them to assess instruction following, a metric that gauges how closely generated text adheres to the given instruction. We introduce a challenging meta-evaluation benchmark, LLMBar, designed to test the ability of an LLM evaluator in discerning instruction-following outputs. The authors manually curated 419 pairs of outputs, one adhering to instructions while the other diverging, yet may possess deceptive qualities that mislead an LLM evaluator, e.g., a more engaging tone. Contrary to existing meta-evaluation, we discover that different evaluators (i.e., combinations of LLMs and prompts) exhibit distinct performance on LLMBar and even the highest-scoring ones have substantial room for improvement. We also present a novel suite of prompting strategies that further close the gap between LLM and human evaluators. With LLMBar, we hope to offer more insight into LLM evaluators and foster future research in developing better instruction-following models.},

Despite being trained on huge volume of data with thousands of features, most Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in industry fail to scale with compute. Inspired by success achieved by Transformers in language and vision domains, we revisit fundamental design choices in recommendation systems. We reformulate recommendation problems as sequential transduction tasks within a generative modeling framework ("Generative Recommenders"), and propose a new architecture, HSTU, designed for high cardinality, non-stationary streaming recommendation data. HSTU outperforms baselines over synthetic and public datasets by up to 65.8\% in NDCG, and is 5.3x to 15.2x faster than FlashAttention2-based Transformers on 8192 length sequences. HSTU-based Generative Recommenders, with 1.5 trillion parameters, improve metrics in online A/B tests by 12.4\% and have been deployed on multiple surfaces of a large internet platform with billions of users. More importantly, the model quality of Generative Recommenders empirically scales as a power-law of training compute across three orders of magnitude, up to GPT-3/LLaMa-2 scale, which reduces carbon footprint needed for future model developments, and further paves the way for the first foundational models in recommendations.},

  abstract = {Following the success of GPT4, there has been a surge in interest in multimodal large language model (MLLM) research. This line of research focuses on developing general-purpose LLMs through fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs and vision models. However, catastrophic forgetting, a notorious phenomenon where the fine-tuned model fails to retain similar performance compared to the pre-trained model, still remains an inherent problem in multimodal LLMs (MLLM). In this paper, we introduce EMT: Evaluating MulTimodality for evaluating the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs, by treating each MLLM as an image classifier. We first apply EMT to evaluate several open-source fine-tuned MLLMs and we discover that almost all evaluated MLLMs fail to retain the same performance levels as their vision encoders on standard image classification tasks. Moreover, we continue fine-tuning LLaVA, an MLLM and utilize EMT to assess performance throughout the fine-tuning. Interestingly, our results suggest that early-stage fine-tuning on an image dataset improves performance across other image datasets, by enhancing the alignment of text and visual features. However, as fine-tuning proceeds, the MLLMs begin to hallucinate, resulting in a significant loss of generalizability, even when the image encoder remains frozen. Our results suggest that MLLMs have yet to demonstrate performance on par with their vision models on standard image classification tasks and the current MLLM fine-tuning procedure still has room for improvement.},

We formulate example selection for in-context learning as a sequential decision problem, and propose a reinforcement learning algorithm for identifying generalizable policies to select demonstration examples.

Although these two paradigms share the goal of enabling LLM-driven task automation, they diverge significantly in architectural complexity, development workflows, and user interaction models. This paper presents the first comprehensive comparative study of API-based and GUI-based LLM agents, systematically analyzing their divergence and potential convergence. We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms.

We believe the ability to ask questions so as to actively clarify the user needs is one of the most important advantages of conversational search and recommendation. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a unified conversational search/recommendation framework, in an attempt to make the research problem doable under a standard formalization. Specifically, we propose a System Ask -- User Respond (SAUR) paradigm for conversational search, define the major components of the paradigm, and design a unified implementation of the framework for product search and recommendation in e-commerce. To accomplish this, we propose the Multi-Memory Network (MMN) architecture, which can be trained based on large-scale collections of user reviews in e-commerce. The system is capable of asking aspect-based questions in the right order so as to understand the user needs, while (personalized) search is conducted during the conversation, and results are provided when the system feels confident. Experiments on real-world user purchasing data verified the advantages of conversational search and recommendation against conventional search and recommendation algorithms in terms of standard evaluation measures such as NDCG.},

In this work, we enhance web agents with an explicit rollback mechanism, enabling the agent to revert back to a previous state in its navigation trajectory. This mechanism gives the model the flexibility to directly control the search process, leading to an effective and efficient web navigation method. We conduct experiments on two live web navigation benchmarks with zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular for graph machine learning and have shown great results on wide node classification tasks. Yet, they are less popular for practical deployments in the industry owing to their scalability challenges incurred by data dependency. Namely, GNN inference depends on neighbor nodes multiple hops away from the target, and fetching them burdens latency-constrained applications. Existing inference acceleration methods like pruning and quantization can speed up GNNs by reducing Multiplication-and-ACcumulation (MAC) operations, but the improvements are limited given the data dependency is not resolved. Conversely, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) have no graph dependency and infer much faster than GNNs, even though they are less accurate than GNNs for node classification in general. Motivated by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, we bring GNNs and MLPs together via knowledge distillation (KD). Our work shows that the performance of MLPs can be improved by large margins with GNN KD. We call the distilled MLPs Graph-less Neural Networks (GLNNs) as they have no inference graph dependency. We show that GLNNs with competitive accuracy infer faster than GNNs by 146X-273X and faster than other acceleration methods by 14X-27X. Under a production setting involving both transductive and inductive predictions across 7 datasets, GLNN accuracies improve over stand-alone MLPs by 12.36\% on average and match GNNs on 6/7 datasets. Comprehensive analysis shows when and why GLNNs can achieve competitive accuracies to GNNs and suggests GLNN as a handy choice for latency-constrained applications.},

Previous work concentrates on modeling a single relationship existing between items in an ongoing session, e.g., sequential dependency or graph structures. They lack the exploration of constituent semantic properties of user intention and also lack effective mechanisms binding important features to deduce user intention accurately. In this paper, we present a novel intention detection-enhanced sequential recommendation model, named DASR, which can capture both sequential dependencies and user intent components. We innovatively introduce slot attention to bind the low-level local features extracted by CNN and design multiple rounds of competitive iteration mechanisms to refine the high-level representation of user intent continuously. Finally, these high-level features cooperate with the global dependencies captured by self-attention to achieve sequential recommendations. Extensive experiments are carried out on three benchmark datasets, the experimental results show that DASR outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods up to 6.91\%, and 4.73\% on Recall@20, and MRR@20, respectively.},

Building ethical LLM-based CAs that respect user privacy requires an in-depth understanding of the privacy risks that concern users the most. However, existing research, primarily model-centered, does not provide insight into users' perspectives. To bridge this gap, we analyzed sensitive disclosures in real-world ChatGPT conversations and conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 LLM-based CA users. We found that users are constantly faced with trade-offs between privacy, utility, and convenience when using LLM-based CAs. However, users' erroneous mental models and the dark patterns in system design limited their awareness and comprehension of the privacy risks. Additionally, the human-like interactions encouraged more sensitive disclosures, which complicated users' ability to navigate the trade-offs. We discuss practical design guidelines and the needs for paradigm shifts to protect the privacy of LLM-based CA users.},

  abstract = {Phrase mining is a fundamental text mining task that aims to identify quality phrases from context. Nevertheless, the scarcity of extensive gold labels datasets, demanding substantial annotation efforts from experts, renders this task exceptionally challenging. Furthermore, the emerging, infrequent, and domain-specific nature of quality phrases presents further challenges in dealing with this task. In this paper, we propose LMPhrase, a novel unsupervised context-aware quality phrase mining framework built upon large pre-trained language models (LMs). Specifically, we first mine quality phrases as silver labels by employing a parameter-free probing technique called Perturbed Masking on the pre-trained language model BERT (coined as Annotator). In contrast to typical statistic-based or distantly-supervised methods, our silver labels, derived from large pre-trained language models, take into account rich contextual information contained in the LMs. As a result, they bring distinct advantages in preserving informativeness, concordance, and completeness of quality phrases. Secondly, training a discriminative span prediction model heavily relies on massive annotated data and is likely to face the risk of overfitting silver labels. Alternatively, we formalize phrase tagging task as the sequence generation problem by directly fine-tuning on the Sequence-to-Sequence pre-trained language model BART with silver labels (coined as Generator). Finally, we merge the quality phrases from both the Annotator and Generator as the final predictions, considering their complementary nature and distinct characteristics. Extensive experiments show that our LMPhrase consistently outperforms all the existing competitors across two different granularity phrase mining tasks, where each task is tested on two different domain datasets.},

During training, Lotus learns latent prompt representations from prompts with gold control signals using a contrastive learning objective.

Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously.

  abstract = {Prevalent supervised learning methods in natural language processing (NLP) are notoriously data-hungry, which demand large amounts of high-quality annotated data. In practice, acquiring such data is a costly endeavor. Recently, the superior few-shot performance of large language models (LLMs) has propelled the development of dataset generation, where the training data are solely synthesized from LLMs. However, such an approach usually suffers from low-quality issues, and requires orders of magnitude more labeled data to achieve satisfactory performance. To fully exploit the potential of LLMs and make use of massive unlabeled data, we propose LLMaAA, which takes LLMs as annotators and puts them into an active learning loop to determine what to annotate efficiently. To learn robustly with pseudo labels, we optimize both the annotation and training processes: (1) we draw k-NN examples from a small demonstration pool as in-context examples, and (2) we adopt the example reweighting technique to assign training samples with learnable weights. Compared with previous approaches, LLMaAA features both efficiency and reliability. We conduct experiments and analysis on two classic NLP tasks, named entity recognition and relation extraction. With LLMaAA, task-specific models trained from LLM-generated labels can outperform the teacher within only hundreds of annotated examples, which is much more cost-effective than other baselines.}

However, due to the lack of designated annotations of controlled summaries, existing works have to craft pseudo datasets by adapting generic summarization benchmarks. Furthermore, most research focuses on controlling single attributes individually (e.g., a short summary or a highly abstractive summary) rather than controlling a mix of attributes together (e.g., a short and highly abstractive summary). In this paper, we propose MACSum, the first human-annotated summarization dataset for controlling mixed attributes. It contains source texts from two domains, news articles and dialogues, with human-annotated summaries controlled by five designed attributes (Length, Extractiveness, Specificity, Topic, and Speaker). We propose two simple and effective parameter-efficient approaches for the new task of mixed controllable summarization based on hard prompt tuning and soft prefix tuning. Results and analysis demonstrate that hard prompt models yield the best performance on all metrics and human evaluations. However, mixed-attribute control is still challenging for summarization tasks. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MACSum.},

Peanut's human-AI collaborative pipeline separates the multi-modal task into two single-modal tasks, and utilizes state-of-the-art object detection and sound-tagging models to reduce the annotators' effort to process each frame and the number of manually-annotated frames needed. A within-subject user study with 20 participants found that Peanut can significantly accelerate the audio-visual data annotation process while maintaining high annotation accuracy.},

However, the optimal methodology for the model to gain such new knowledge remains an open question. In this paper, we present Retrieval Augmented FineTuning (RAFT), a training recipe that improves the model's ability to answer questions in a "open-book" in-domain settings. In RAFT, given a question, and a set of retrieved documents, we train the model to ignore those documents that don't help in answering the question, which we call, distractor documents. RAFT accomplishes this by citing verbatim the right sequence from the relevant document that would help answer the question. This coupled with RAFT's chain-of-thought-style response helps improve the model's ability to reason. In domain-specific RAG, RAFT consistently improves the model's performance across PubMed, HotpotQA, and Gorilla datasets, presenting a post-training recipe to improve pre-trained LLMs to in-domain RAG.

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.},

  abstract = {NLP is currently dominated by general-purpose pretrained language models like RoBERTa, which achieve strong performance on NLU tasks through pretraining on billions of words. But what exact knowledge or skills do Transformer LMs learn from large-scale pretraining that they cannot learn from less data? We adopt four probing methods---classifier probing, information-theoretic probing, unsupervised relative acceptability judgment, and fine-tuning on NLU tasks---and draw learning curves that track the growth of these different measures of linguistic ability with respect to pretraining data volume using the MiniBERTas, a group of RoBERTa models pretrained on 1M, 10M, 100M and 1B words. We find that LMs require only about 10M or 100M words to learn representations that reliably encode most syntactic and semantic features we test. A much larger quantity of data is needed in order to acquire enough commonsense knowledge and other skills required to master typical downstream NLU tasks. The results suggest that, while the ability to encode linguistic features is almost certainly necessary for language understanding, it is likely that other forms of knowledge are the major drivers of recent improvements in language understanding among large pretrained models.},

However, it is challenging to generate questions that capture the interesting aspects of a fairytale story with educational meaningfulness. In this paper, we propose a novel question generation method that first learns the question type distribution of an input story paragraph, and then summarizes salient events which can be used to generate high-cognitive-demand questions. To train the event-centric summarizer, we finetune a pre-trained transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model using silver samples composed by educational question-answer pairs. On a newly proposed educational question answering dataset FairytaleQA, we show good performance of our method on both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our work indicates the necessity of decomposing question type distribution learning and event-centric summary generation for educational question generation.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based recommender systems (RSs) have garnered considerable attention due to their ability to learn optimal recommendation policies and maximize long-term user rewards. However, deploying RL models directly in online environments and generating authentic data through A/B tests can pose challenges and require substantial resources. Simulators offer an alternative approach by providing training and evaluation environments for RS models, reducing reliance on real-world data. Existing simulators have shown promising results but also have limitations such as simplified user feedback, lacking consistency with real-world data, the challenge of simulator evaluation, and difficulties in migration and expansion across RSs. To address these challenges, we propose KuaiSim, a comprehensive user environment that provides user feedback with multi-behavior and cross-session responses. The resulting simulator can support three levels of recommendation problems: the request level list-wise recommendation task, the whole-session level sequential recommendation task, and the cross-session level retention optimization task. For each task, KuaiSim also provides evaluation protocols and baseline recommendation algorithms that further serve as benchmarks for future research. We also restructure existing competitive simulators on the KuaiRand Dataset and compare them against KuaiSim to future assess their performance and behavioral differences. Furthermore, to showcase KuaiSim's flexibility in accommodating different datasets, we demonstrate its versatility and robustness when deploying it on the ML-1m dataset.},

  abstract = {Drafting-then-verifying decoding methods such as speculative decoding are widely adopted training-free methods to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs). Instead of employing an autoregressive process to decode tokens sequentially, speculative decoding initially creates drafts with an efficient small model. Then LLMs are required to conduct verification and correction in a non-autoregressive fashion to minimize time overhead. Generating longer drafts can lead to even more significant speedups once verified, but also incurs substantial trial and error costs if it fails. Suffering from the high verification failure probability, existing decoding methods cannot draft too much content for verification at one time, achieving sub-optimal inference acceleration. In this paper, we introduce Ouroboros, which constructs a phrase candidate pool from the verification process of LLMs to provide candidates for draft generation of the small model. Thereby, Ouroboros can further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the initial drafts. The experimental results on typical text generation tasks show that Ouroboros achieves speedups of up to 1.9x and 2.8x compared to lookahead decoding and speculative decoding, respectively.

With PyHealth, they can conduct complex machine learning pipelines on healthcare datasets with fewer than ten lines of code. The data preprocessing module enables the transformation of complex healthcare datasets such as longitudinal electronic health records, medical images, continuous signals (e.g., electrocardiogram), and clinical notes into machine learning friendly formats. The predictive modeling module provides more than 30 machine learning models, including established ensemble trees and deep neural network-based approaches, via a unified but extendable API designed for both researchers and practitioners. The evaluation module provides various evaluation strategies (e.g., cross-validation and train-validation-test split) and predictive model metrics.

Additionally, FSDP natively incorporates a range of techniques and settings to optimize resource utilization across a variety of hardware configurations.

As a result, recent studies have actively attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems. Therefore, in this survey, we comprehensively review LLM-empowered recommender systems from various perspectives including pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting paradigms. More specifically, we first introduce the representative methods to learn user and item representations, leveraging LLMs as feature encoders. Then, we systematically review the emerging advanced techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the promising future directions in this emerging field.},

DGL-KE introduces various novel optimizations that accelerate training on knowledge graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges using multi-processing, multi-GPU, and distributed parallelism.

In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents -- it can successfully complete 51.1 of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting turns out to be not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML structure and visuals. Yet, there is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for further improvement.

  abstract = {While self-supervised learning has made rapid advances in natural language processing, it remains unclear when researchers should engage in resource-intensive domain-specific pretraining (domain pretraining). The law, puzzlingly, has yielded few documented instances of substantial gains to domain pretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be unique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that existing legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when domain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case {$<$}u{$>$}H{$<$}/u{$>$}oldings {$<$}u{$>$}O{$<$}/u{$>$}n {$<$}u{$>$}L{$<$}/u{$>$}egal {$<$}u{$>$}D{$<$}/u{$>$}ecisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple choice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset presents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and difficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second, we assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While a Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books and Wikipedia) improves performance, domain pretraining (on a corpus of {$\approx$}3.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than BERT's) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial performance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2\% on F1, representing a 12\% improvement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal tasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task exhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of performance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain specificity of the task. Our findings inform when researchers should engage in resource-intensive pretraining and show that Transformer-based architectures, too, learn embeddings suggestive of distinct legal language.},

In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of personas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise. Through extensive analysis of 4 popular families of LLMs and 2,410 factual questions, we demonstrate that adding personas in system prompts does not improve model performance across a range of questions compared to the control setting where no persona is added. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that the gender, type, and domain of the persona can all influence the resulting prediction accuracies. We further experimented with a list of persona search strategies and found that, while aggregating results from the best persona for each question significantly improves prediction accuracy, automatically identifying the best persona is challenging, with predictions often performing no better than random selection. Overall, our findings suggest that while adding a persona may lead to performance gains in certain settings, the effect of each persona can be largely random. \%Our results can help inform the design of system prompts for AI systems.

Effective product descriptions can address the 'cold start' problem, align with market trends, and ultimately lead to increased click-through rates. Traditional methods for crafting these descriptions often involve significant human effort and may lack both consistency and scalability. This paper introduces a novel methodology for automating product description generation using the LLAMA 2.0 7B language model. We train the model on a dataset of authentic product descriptions from Walmart, one of the largest eCommerce platforms. The model is then fine-tuned for domain-specific language features and eCommerce nuances to enhance its utility in sales and user engagement. We employ multiple evaluation metrics, including NDCG, customer click-through rates, and human assessments, to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings reveal that the system is not only scalable but also significantly reduces the human workload involved in creating product descriptions.

  abstract = {Large language models are trained in two stages: (1) unsupervised pretraining from raw text, to learn general-purpose representations, and (2) large scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, to better align to end tasks and user preferences. We measure the relative importance of these two stages by training LIMA, a 65B parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with the standard supervised loss on only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, without any reinforcement learning or human preference modeling. LIMA demonstrates remarkably strong performance, learning to follow specific response formats from only a handful of examples in the training data, including complex queries that range from planning trip itineraries to speculating about alternate history. Moreover, the model tends to generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data. In a controlled human study, responses from LIMA are either equivalent or strictly preferred to GPT-4 in 43\% of cases; this statistic is as high as 58\% when compared to Bard and 65\% versus DaVinci003, which was trained with human feedback. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that almost all knowledge in large language models is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning data is necessary to teach models to produce high quality output.},

However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLM inference pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Efforts within the field have been directed towards developing techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on efficient LLM inference. We start by analyzing the primary causes of the inefficient LLM inference, i.e., the large model size, the quadratic-complexity attention operation, and the auto-regressive decoding approach. Then, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the current literature into data-level, model-level, and system-level optimization. Moreover, the paper includes comparative experiments on representative methods within critical sub-fields to provide quantitative insights.

However, existing multi-turn RL algorithms for optimizing LLM agents fail to perform effective credit assignment over multiple turns while leveraging the generalization capabilities of LLMs and it remains unclear how to develop such algorithms. To study this, we first introduce a new benchmark, ColBench, where an LLM agent interacts with a human collaborator over multiple turns to solve realistic tasks in backend programming and frontend design. Building on this benchmark, we propose a novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with Step-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses a carefully designed optimization objective to train a critic model with access to additional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards for improving the policy model. Our experiments demonstrate that SWEET-RL achieves a 6\% absolute improvement in success and win rates on ColBench compared to other state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms, enabling Llama-3.1-8B to match or exceed the performance of GPT4-o in realistic collaborative content creation.},

Deep-learning models for aiding diagnosis have yet to meet this requirement of leveraging multimodal information. Here we report a transformer-based representation-learning model as a clinical diagnostic aid that processes multimodal input in a unified manner. Rather than learning modality-specific features, the model leverages embedding layers to convert images and unstructured and structured text into visual tokens and text tokens, and uses bidirectional blocks with intramodal and intermodal attention to learn holistic representations of radiographs, the unstructured chief complaint and clinical history, and structured clinical information such as laboratory test results and patient demographic information. The unified model outperformed an image-only model and non-unified multimodal diagnosis models in the identification of pulmonary disease (by 12\% and 9\%, respectively) and in the prediction of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (by 29\% and 7\%, respectively). Unified multimodal transformer-based models may help streamline the triaging of patients and facilitate the clinical decision-making process.},

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41\%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24\%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.

In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of the calibration of aligned language models throughout the entire construction process, including pretraining and alignment training. At each stage, we investigate how different training settings, such as parameter scales and training data, affect model calibration. To thoroughly assess model calibration, we evaluate models on three most concerned aspects: generation, factuality and understanding.

  abstract = {The captivating realm of Minecraft has attracted substantial research interest in recent years, serving as a rich platform for developing intelligent agents capable of functioning in open-world environments. However, the current research landscape predominantly focuses on specific objectives, such as the popular "ObtainDiamond" task, and has not yet shown effective generalization to a broader spectrum of tasks. Furthermore, the current leading success rate for the "ObtainDiamond" task stands at around 20\%, highlighting the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) based controllers used in existing methods. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Ghost in the Minecraft (GITM), a novel framework integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-based knowledge and memory, aiming to create Generally Capable Agents (GCAs) in Minecraft. These agents, equipped with the logic and common sense capabilities of LLMs, can skillfully navigate complex, sparse-reward environments with text-based interactions. We develop a set of structured actions and leverage LLMs to generate action plans for the agents to execute. The resulting LLM-based agent markedly surpasses previous methods, achieving a remarkable improvement of +47.5\% in success rate on the "ObtainDiamond" task, demonstrating superior robustness compared to traditional RL-based controllers. Notably, our agent is the first to procure all items in the Minecraft Overworld technology tree, demonstrating its extensive capabilities. GITM does not need any GPU for training, but a single CPU node with 32 CPU cores is enough. This research shows the potential of LLMs in developing capable agents for handling long-horizon, complex tasks and adapting to uncertainties in open-world environments.

To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. We train JudgeLM at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias. To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance. JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark. Our JudgeLM is efficient and the JudgeLM-7B only needs 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs. JudgeLM obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90\% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement. JudgeLM also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, and multi-turn chat.},

Motivated by the urgent need for swift decision-making during new disease outbreaks, where traditional predictive models often fail due to a lack of historical data, this research investigates the adaptability of LLMs, like GPT-4, to EHR data. We particularly focus on their zero-shot capabilities, which enable them to make predictions in scenarios in which they haven't been explicitly trained. In response to the longitudinal, sparse, and knowledge-infused nature of EHR data, our prompting approach involves taking into account specific EHR characteristics such as units and reference ranges, and employing an in-context learning strategy that aligns with clinical contexts. Our comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV and TJH datasets demonstrate that with our elaborately designed prompting framework, LLMs can improve prediction performance in key tasks such as mortality, length-of-stay, and 30-day readmission by about 35{\textbackslash}\%, surpassing ML models in few-shot settings. Our research underscores the potential of LLMs in enhancing clinical decision-making, especially in urgent healthcare situations like the outbreak of emerging diseases with no labeled data.

Active learning focuses on carefully selecting as few labeled instances as possible for learning an accurate predictive model. Streaming data poses additional challenges for active learning, since the data distribution may change over time (concept drift) and models need to adapt. Conventional active learning strategies concentrate on querying the most uncertain instances, which are typically concentrated around the decision boundary. Changes occurring further from the boundary may be missed, and models may fail to adapt. This paper presents a theoretically supported framework for active learning from drifting data streams and develops three active learning strategies for streaming data that explicitly handle concept drift. They are based on uncertainty, dynamic allocation of labeling efforts over time, and randomization of the search space. We empirically demonstrate that these strategies react well to changes that can occur anywhere in the instance space and unexpectedly.},
